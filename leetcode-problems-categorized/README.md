# leetcode-problems-categorized

In this project I scrape all the public problems listed on leetcode.com and extract the important information related to each problem - including the question title, difficulty, content, hyperlink, number of likes/dislikes, number of acceptance/submissions, related topics and related questions.

The python script used for the scraping is also provided. Note: this project is only for study purposes and may not be used for profit in any form.

The results are stored in `LC_problems.csv`.
