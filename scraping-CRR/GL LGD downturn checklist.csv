According to Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, competent authorities must notify the EBA as to whether they comply or intend to comply with these guidelines, or otherwise with reasons for non-compliance, by ([dd.mm.yyyy]). In the absence of any notification by this deadline, competent authorities will be considered by the EBA to be non-compliant. Notifications should be sent by submitting the form available on the EBA website to compliance@eba.europa.eu with the reference 'EBA/GL/2019/03'. Notifications should be submitted by persons with appropriate authority to report compliance on behalf of their competent authorities. Any change in the status of compliance must also be reported to EBA."
,,"4. Notifications will be published on the EBA website, in line with Article 16(3)."
"2 Subject matter, scope and definitions",,
,Subject matter,
,,"5. These guidelines specify the requirements for the estimation of loss given default (LGD) appropriate for an economic downturn in accordance with Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3, Section 6 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, Article 181 of that Regulation and the EBA final draft regulatory technical standards on the IRB assessment methodology EBA/RTS/2016/03 [RTS on IRB assessment methodology] of 21 July 2016 as well as EBA final draft regulatory standards on the specification of an economic downturn EBA /RTS/2018/04 [RTS on economic downturn] of 16 November 2018. These guidelines should be considered as an amendment of EBA on PD estimation, LGD estimation and the treatment of defaulted exposures EBA/GL/2017/16 [EBA GL on PD and LGD] published on 20 November 2017."
,Scope of application,
,,"6. These guidelines apply in relation to the IRB Approach in accordance with Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 for all methods based on own estimates of LGD. The use of own estimates of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn, in accordance with these guidelines, is subject to supervisory approval in accordance with Article 144 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. These guidelines do not apply to the calculation of own funds requirements for dilution risk in accordance with Article 157 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013."
,Addressees,
,,7. These guidelines are addressed to competent authorities as defined in point (i) of Article 4(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 and to financial institutions as defined in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
,Definitions,
,,"8. Unless otherwise specified, terms used and defined in in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Directive 2013/36/EU and in [EBA GL on PD and LGD] have the same meaning in the guidelines. In addition, for the purposes of these guidelines, the following definitions apply: Quantification of downturn LGD: Quantification of downturn LGD covers all elements of the quantification of downturn LGD including the quantification of the calibration target, the quantification of the resulting downturn LGD estimates at grade and pool level and the quantification of the margin of conservatism (MoC). Calibration of downturn LGD: The term calibration of downturn LGD in the context of these guidelines refers to the quantification of the calibration target at the relevant level. Downturn LGD estimates: These are the LGD estimates appropriate for an economic downturn at the grade or pool level after calibration but before the application of MoC."
3 Implementation,,
,Date of application,
,,"9. These guidelines apply from 1 January 2021. Institutions should incorporate the requirements of these guidelines in their rating systems by that time, but competent authorities may accelerate the timeline of this transition at their discretion."
,First application of these Guidelines,
,,"10. The internal validation function of institution should verify the changes which are applied to the rating systems as a result of the application of these guidelines, consistently with EBA final draft regulatory technical standards on the IRB assessment methodology EBA/RTS/2016/03 [RTS on IRB assessment methodology] of 21 July 2016 and the classification of the changes in accordance with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/201411."
,,11. Institutions that need to obtain prior permission from competent authorities in accordance with Article 143(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Regulation (EU) No 529/2014 for the changes in the rating systems required to incorporate these guidelines for the first time by the deadline referred to in paragraph 9 should agree with their competent authorities the final deadline for submitting the application for such prior permission.
,,"12. Prior to the application of these guidelines, institutions need to identify the relevant downturn periods for the type of exposure under consideration in accordance with EBA submitted [RTS on economic downturn]. The guidelines will be adapted, where relevant, when the RTS on economic downturn are published in their final version in the OJ."
4 General requirements on downturn,,
,LGD estimation,
,,"13. For the purpose of quantifying LGDs that are appropriate for an economic downturn, institutions should apply all definitions and all requirements set out in Section 4, Section 6, Section 7, Section 8 and Section 9 of the EBA Guidelines on PD estimation, LGD estimation and the treatment of defaulted exposures (EBA/GL/2017/16) of 20/11/2017 (EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation) that are relevant for this purpose."
,,"14. In addition to paragraph 13, for the purpose of quantifying downturn LGD institutions should apply the following requirements specific to downturn LGD estimates by facility grade or pool: (a) calibrate downturn LGD at least at the same level at which institutions calculate the corresponding long-run average LGD for the purpose of calibrating LGD in accordance with paragraph 161 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation]."
,,"(b) split the set of facilities covered by the same LGD model into as many different calibration segments as needed where each calibration segment carries a significantly different loss profile and might thus be affected differently by different downturn periods; for this purpose, institutions should at least consider the appropriateness of introducing calibration segments that cover material shares of exposure in different geographical areas, in different industry sectors and, for retail exposures, of different product types;"
,,15. Where institutions identify multiple downturn periods in accordance with the final draft
,,"RTS on economic downturn submitted by EBA [RTS on economic downturn], (a) they should perform each of the steps in the following sequence: (i) calibrate downturn LGD for each identified downturn period in accordance with Section 4.3 for each calibration segment; (ii) for each of those downturn periods, apply the resulting downturn LGD estimates to their current non-defaulted exposures of the type of exposures under consideration and at the time of calibration; (iii) choose the period as finally relevant downturn period that results in the highest average downturn LGD, including final MoC as set out in paragraph 45 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], on a considered calibration segment of their current non-defaulted exposures as referred to in (ii). Institutions should then use the resulting downturn LGDs based on the finally relevant downturn period for each calibration segment to comply with paragraph 181 (b) CRR."
,,(iv) in case that institutions can calibrate downturn LGD in accordance with Section
,,"5 or Section 6 for at least one downturn period but they are unable to quantify downturn LGD in accordance with Section 5 or Section 6 for one or several other downturn periods, consider only the estimates based on Section 5 or Section 6, and add appropriate Category A MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a) of "
,,[EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] to the final downturn LGD estimates to cover for the downturn periods where sufficient and relevant loss data to assess or estimate the impact is not available;
,,"(b) In derogation to paragraph 15(a)(i), institutions do not need to provide a calibration of downturn LGD for a considered calibration segment for downturn periods identified in accordance with the [RTS on economic downturn] where institutions can provide evidence that the according economic factors are not relevant for the considered calibration segment."
,,4.1 Requirements that apply to the final downturn LGD estimates
,,"16. For the purpose of ensuring that the resulting downturn LGDs are used if they are more conservative than the according long-run average LGDs in line with Article 181(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should apply the following:"
,,(a) where institutions use separate estimation methodologies for long-run average
,,"LGD and downturn LGD, compare their final downturn LGDs used for calibration plus the according final MoC as set out in paragraph 45 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], to their long-run average LGDs plus the according final MoC as set out in paragraph 45 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] at the level where the long-run average LGD is calculated for the purpose of calibrating LGD in accordance with paragraph 161 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation]; (b) where institutions set a single LGD estimate, which involves a long-run average LGD estimation and a downturn adjustment added to the long-run average LGD estimation, they should ensure that the final MoC as set out in paragraph 45 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] on the downturn LGD estimates encompasses the uncertainties stemming from both the long-run average LGD estimation and the calculation of the downturn adjustment."
,,"17. For models with risk drivers sensitive to the economic cycle, institutions should ensure that the resulting downturn LGD estimates are not unduly sensitive to changes in economic cycle. For this purpose, institutions should do all of the following: (a) analyse the difference between the distribution of exposures over facility grades or pools, or over appropriate intervals in case of continuous facility scales, of the current portfolio and the likely distribution of the current portfolio impacted by the relevant downturn period selected in accordance with paragraph 15, (b) if there is a substantial difference as a result of the analysis in (a), institutions should apply an adjustment to their downturn LGD estimates to limit the capital impact of an economic downturn in accordance with Article 181(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013."
,,18. Institutions should compare the final downturn LGD with the reference value calculated in accordance with Section 8 on the according RDS and calculated at least at the level of calibration segments. Institutions should justify any material difference between the final downturn LGD and the reference value.
,,"19. When comparing the final downturn LGD with the reference value in line with paragraph 18, institutions should take into account all of the following:"
,,"(a) A material difference between the final downturn LGD plus final MoC as set out in paragraph 45 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation](s) and the reference value can be justified if the period of losses identified by the reference value does not stem from a - potentially unidentified - downturn period or if the difference is due to the minimum MoC requirement in paragraph 36(b) where the downturn LGD is based on the methodology in Section 7. In case that the underlying downturn LGD is based on the methodology in Section 5, institutions may use the evidence gathered from the impact assessment in paragraph 27."
,,"(b) If the material difference between the final downturn LGD and the reference value cannot be justified, institutions should re-assess their quantification of downturn LGD ensuring in particular that the downturn periods have been identified comprehensively and that, where intermediate parameters are used, the impact of the relevant downturn period observed (based on Section 5) or estimated (based on Section 6) on intermediate parameters has been aggregated adequately. After the institution has re-assessed its quantification of downturn LGD, and the methodology is assessed to be adequate, a material difference from the reference value can be explained."
,,4.2 Downturn LGD estimation for defaulted exposures
,,"20. For downturn LGD estimation for defaulted exposures, institutions should use the same downturn period as identified for the corresponding non-defaulted exposures."
,,"21. For downturn LGD estimation for defaulted exposures for the downturn period referred to in paragraph 20, institutions should comply with all of the following:"
,,(a) The downturn component of LGD estimation for defaulted exposures as referred to in paragraph 193(b)(i) of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] should be quantified by either: (i) calibrating downturn LGD for the defaulted exposures under consideration for each reference date in accordance with Section 4.3 by inferring the downturn component of the LGD in default for each reference date based on the difference between the downturn LGD estimates and ELBE; or (ii) first calibrating downturn LGD in accordance with Section 4.3 for the defaulted exposures under consideration for the moment of default and subsequently inferring the downturn component of the LGD in default at other reference dates  based on the difference between the downturn LGD estimates at the moment of default and ELBE at the moment of default.
,,"(b) In order to comply with paragraph 21(a)(ii), institutions may use the downturn component of the LGD estimates for non-defaulted exposures instead of the downturn component for defaulted exposures at the moment of default where the institution can provide evidence that this results in more conservative estimates."
,,"(c) In order to comply with paragraph 21(b) and where institutions use separate estimation methodologies for long-run average and downturn LGD in accordance with paragraph 16(a), the downturn component of the LGD estimates for non-defaulted exposures may be inferred by considering the difference between the resulting downturn LGD estimates and the corresponding long-run average LGDs taking into account paragraph 193 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation]."
,,4.3 Downturn LGD estimation for a considered downturn period
,,"22. For the purpose of calibrating downturn LGD for each considered downturn period identified in accordance with Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn], institutions should use one of the three types of approaches set out in Section 5, Section 6 and Section 7 of these guidelines in accordance with the hierarchy set out in paragraphs 23 to 25 below."
,,"23. Where institutions have sufficient and relevant loss data to conduct the impact analysis set out in paragraph 27, they should calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 5 of these guidelines. For this purpose, institutions should ensure that the relevant loss data is available during the considered downturn period as well as during an appropriate period before and after the considered downturn period."
,,"24. Where sufficient and relevant loss data to assess the impact of the considered downturn period is not available but it is possible to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period by applying the approach set out in Section 6, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 6 of these guidelines."
,,"25. Where sufficient and relevant loss data to assess the impact of the considered downturn period is not available, and it is not possible to quantify downturn LGD for the considered downturn period by applying the approach set out in Section 6, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 7 of these guidelines."
,,"26. Regardless of the approach used for calibrating downturn LGD institutions should adhere to the following principles (a) where the approach used involves the estimation or analysis of different intermediate parameters, the aggregation of these intermediate parameters for the purpose of calibrating downturn LGD should start with the parameter where the highest impact is observed in accordance with paragraph 27 or estimated in  accordance with paragraph 30 and any additional impact observed or estimated on other parameters should be added where necessary."
,,(b) The downturn LGD estimates should not be biased by observed or estimated cash flows that are received with a significantly longer time lag than the period referred to in paragraph 156 of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] and which might rather reflect an upturn or improved economic conditions following the considered downturn period.
5 Downturn LGD estimation based on observed impact,,
,,"27. In order to calibrate downturn LGD based on the observed impact of a considered downturn period, institutions should carry out an analysis of the impact of this downturn period on the loss data related to the considered calibration segment."
,,"(a) The analysis shall comprise at a minimum all of the following: (i) evidence of elevated levels of realised LGDs, driven by the considered downturn period taking into account all of the following: (1)the realised LGDs should be calculated as averages related to all defaults that occurred in a considered year and that have either reached their maximum time of recovery in accordance with paragraph 156 [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] or have been closed before; (2) for all incomplete recovery processes of defaulted exposures that have not reached their maximum time of recovery in accordance with paragraph 156 [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], the marginal recoveries reached in each year after defaultshould be computed. The resulting recovery patterns should be compared to the recovery patterns of the defaults considered in letter (1) for each year in which the defaults occurred. (ii) evidence of decreased annual recoveries by sources of recoveries that are relevant for the considered calibration segment. These annual recoveries should be analysed with and without repossessions where applicable and irrespective of the date of default; (iii) evidence of decreased numbers of exposures that defaulted and returned back to the non-defaulted status within a predefined fixed horizons for all defaults that happened in a considered year in accordance with Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; The predefined fixed horizon should be appropriate for the type of exposure under consideration."
,,(iv) evidence of increased time in default per year related to all defaults in a considered year. 
,,"(b) The analysis required in paragraph 27(a) shall take into account as many points in time as possible where sufficient relevant loss data is available. Otherwise, if only scarce relevant loss data is available on an annual basis, institutions should merge consecutive years of observations as long as deemed of added value for the analysis."
,,"(c) The analysis required in paragraph 27(a) and (b), shall take into account any lag between a downturn period and the time when its potential impact is observed on the relevant loss data."
,,"28. Based on the evidence obtained from the impact analysis referred to in paragraph 27, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD by applying an estimation methodology which is coherent with the evidence obtained from the impact analysis."
,,"29. Where the impact analysis conducted in accordance with paragraph 27 shows no impact of a downturn period on an institution's relevant loss data, such that the average observed realised losses in this downturn period are not different from those under other economic conditions, the institution may use the long-run average LGD as downturn LGD, where all of the following applies: (a) the institution ensures and documents that the deficiencies identified and MoC applied in accordance with Section 4.4 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] incorporate all additional elements of uncertainty related to the identified downturn periods; (b) for the purpose of letter (a), the institution should in particular verify that, for the considered downturn period, none of the deficiencies identified under the Category A, MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a) of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] are of higher severity and that no additional deficiencies or adjustments under the Category B MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(b) of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] are applicable."
6 Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact,,
,,"30. Where paragraph 24 applies, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD using one of the methodologies specified in paragraph 31 ('haircut approach') and paragraph 32 ('extrapolation approach') or a combination of those. Prior to quantifying its downturn LGD estimates, institutions should choose the most relevant methodology based on: (a) the appropriateness of the methodology to estimate the impact of the downturn period under consideration on a realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers; (b) where relevant, the need to use a combination of the methodologies to ensure that the resulting downturn LGDs for the downturn period under consideration adequately reflect a potential downturn impact on all material components of  economic loss in accordance with Section 6.3.1 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] and in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 26; In particular the haircut approach should be considered most appropriate for the above purposes where the market value or an according index related to a relevant type of collateral serves as a direct or transformed input into an institution's model for LGD estimation and has been identified as a relevant economic factor in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn]. 31. ('Haircut approach') For the purpose of these guidelines, a 'haircut approach' refers to an approach for the estimation of the impact of the downturn period on realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers in which one or several economic factors as referred to in Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn] are direct or transformed input(s) in the LGD model and where for the purpose of this estimation these input(s) are adjusted to reflect the impact of the downturn period under consideration. In particular, where the considered economic factor relates to the downturn period under consideration, the haircut should be based on the most severe observation of this economic factor in accordance with the specification of the severity of an economic downturn laid down in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn]. 32. ('Extrapolation Approach') For the purposes of these guidelines, an 'extrapolation approach' refers to the estimation of the impact of the downturn period under consideration on LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers if all of the following conditions are met: (a) where a statistically significant dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers, averaged over appropriate periods in time, and the economic factorsselected in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn] which are relevant for the downturn period under consideration, can be established the resulting estimates are based on the extrapolated values of the average realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers to the period reflecting the impact of the downturn period; (b) where no statistically significant dependency as described in paragraph 32(a) can be established for an intermediate parameter or risk driver, institutions may estimate the impact of the downturn period under consideration on an intermediate parameter or risk driver based on observed data from a different period, where all of following three conditions are met: (i) at least those components of economic loss that explain the major share of the total economic loss should be estimated by either a haircut approach in accordance with paragraph 31 or an extrapolation approach in accordance with paragraph 32(a); (ii) the institution has observed data for the intermediate parameter or risk driver for a sufficient period of time which is at least as long as the period referred to in Article 181(1)(j) or Article 181(2), last subparagraph of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; this period of time should include a period  where the economic factor(s) underlying the considered downturn period show values representing adverse economic conditions. (iii) the intermediate parameter or risk driver under consideration shows low volatility in the periods referred to in sub point (ii)."
,,33. Where institutions have observed data covering the downturn period and reflecting the impact of the respective downturn conditions under consideration on an intermediate parameter or risk driver they should use the observed data in combination with the Haircut or Extrapolation Approach to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with paragraph 30.
,,"34. Where institutions apply any of the approaches outlined in paragraphs 31 to 33 for the purpose of estimating intermediate parameters or risk drivers, they should ensure that the dependency structure between intermediate parameters or risk drivers is reflected appropriately in the aggregation of these intermediate parameters or risk drivers in accordance with paragraph 30."
,,"35. To reflect the lack of sufficient loss data, institutions should quantify a strictly positive"
,,"Category A MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a)(xi) of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] for all approaches in this section. In particular, institutions applying an extrapolation approach: (a) as referred to in paragraph 32(a), should quantify the Category A MoC by using an appropriate confidence interval to reflect the uncertainty related to the statistical model used to describe the dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers and the relevant economic factors; (b) for an intermediate parameter or risk driver as referred to in paragraph 32(b), should quantify the Category A MoC taking into account the ratio of the value(s) of the economic factor(s) underlying the considered downturn period identified in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn] and value(s) of the relevant economic factor(s) observed in the periods referred to in paragraph 32(b)(ii)."
7 Downturn LGD estimation where observed or estimated impact is not available,,
,,"36. Where the relevant loss data to assess the impact of the downturn period under consideration is not available and it is also not possible to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 6 of these guidelines, institutions  should quantify downturn LGD through any other approach subject to the following conditions:"
,,(a) they should ensure that the appropriate MoC required to be applied in accordance with Section 4.4.3 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] includes a Category A
,,MoC that is strictly positive to account for the missing data;
,,(b) they should ensure that the resulting downturn LGD estimates including the final
,,"MoC as set out in paragraph 45 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], for the considered downturn period are higher or equal to the minimum between  the according long-run average LGDs plus an add-on of 15 percentage points and 105%; Moreover, they should provide justification to the satisfaction of the competent authority that they cannot calibrate downturn LGD appropriate for the considered downturn period by applying any of the approaches set out in Section 5 and Section 6 of these guidelines."
8 Reference Value,,
,,37. Institutions should calculate a reference value in accordance with the following sequence of steps:
,,"(a) Using all available loss data, institutions should select the two individual years with the highest observed economic loss by: (i) grouping all defaults according to the year in which the defaults occurred; (ii) for each year as identified in (i) calculating for the defaults that occurred in the considered year the ratio of total economic loss as specified in Section 6.3.1 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] to the total outstanding amount of the according credit obligations at the moment of default; (iii) selecting the two individual years with the highest annual ratio of total economic loss to total outstanding amount resulting from (ii) as the two individual years with the highest observed economic losses."
,,"(b) Institutions should calculate the reference value(s) at least for each calibration segment as the simple average of the average realised LGDs from the two individual years with the highest observed economic losses, as identified in paragraph 37(a)(iii)."
