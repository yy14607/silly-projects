Foreword
"1. Articles 143, 283 and 363 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) 1 require the European Central Bank (ECB) to grant permission to use internal models for credit risk, counterparty credit risk and market risk where the requirements set out in the corresponding chapters of the CRR are met by the institutions concerned. Based on the current applicable European Union (EU) and national law, the ECB guide to internal models provides transparency on how the ECB understands those rules and how it intends to apply them when assessing whether institutions meet these requirements."
"2. The guide is also intended as a document for the internal use of the different supervisory teams, with the aim of ensuring a common and consistent approach to matters related to internal models. When applying the relevant regulatory framework in specific cases, the ECB will take into due consideration the particular circumstances of the institution concerned."
"3. This guide should not be construed as going beyond the current existing applicable EU and national law and therefore is not intended to replace, overrule or affect applicable EU and national law. In accordance with the requirements set out in the CRR, the European Banking Authority (EBA) has drafted regulatory technical standards (RTS). These include the Final Draft RTS on assessment methodology for the Internal Ratings-based (IRB) Approach, the Final Draft RTS on the specification of the nature, severity and duration of an economic downturn and the Final Draft RTS on the specification of the assessment methodology for competent authorities regarding compliance of an institution with the requirement to use internal models for market risk and assessment of significant share. 2 These specify how competent authorities should assess compliance with the regulatory framework defined in the CRR. The Final Draft RTS have not yet been adopted by the European Commission, but those Final Draft RTS are referred to in the guide as good practice for interpretative purposes. Some parts of this guide may require revision once the European Commission has adopted the RTS by means of a Delegated Regulation. The ECB will amend or delete those parts of the guide when the RTS enter into force. The ECB provides in this guide its understanding of the CRR provisions which apply currently. The legal references in this guide to the CRR provisions (including the number of the Articles) are references to the CRR before the amendments introduced by Regulation (EU) 2019/876 3. The amendments introduced by Regulation (EU) 2019/876 which have an impact on the guide will only apply from July 2021."

General topics
1 Overarching principles for internal models
1.1 Relevant regulatory references
"1. The principles listed in this section relate to internal models that are subject to supervisory approval for the calculation of own funds requirements for credit, market and counterparty credit risk (Pillar 1 models), unless stated otherwise."
1.2 Guidelines at consolidated and subsidiary levels
"2. An inconsistent implementation of internal model-related tasks within a banking group bears the risk of an inappropriate coverage of the risks measured by internal models at group level. Therefore, institutions should either develop binding group-wide (i.e. consolidated) principles and guidelines relating to the life cycle 4 of internal models 5, or ensure that each relevant entity has appropriate and independently audited principles and guidelines in place with a high degree of consistency between one another."
"3. A consistent and integrated level of application of the group principles and guidelines in the relevant entities is expected. This could be ensured by applying controls that verify that these principles are implemented correctly in all relevant entities. Examples of such controls include periodic monitoring procedures by the parent entity on implementation at local level or a gap analysis between group-wide principles and local application, including local guidelines. These controls can be used to identify those gaps and to mitigate any associated risk. The group-level policies should clearly define under which circumstances deviations from the group-wide principles would be accepted. The parent entity should be informed about such deviations. The effective implementation of the policies should be periodically monitored and assessed."
1.3 Documentation of internal models
"4. All internal models should be documented to allow a qualified third party to independently understand the methodology, assumptions, limitations and use of the model and to replicate its development and implementation."
"5. The institution should therefore define principles and guidelines for model documentation. These should encompass guidance for the governance of the model documentation itself. The scope of the model documentation should be defined by type of model. In-scope areas should include at least the technical aspects of the model (methodology and assumptions), data (processes), instructions for model users and performance/validation (including the results of implementation testing)."
"6. The institution should be able to demonstrate how its documentation and the register of its internal models facilitate the internal and external understanding of the models. The institution can choose to have one or more registers for models in use, according to the different risk types (credit, market or counterparty credit risk). The register(s) should contain at least the following information for each model: 6 the model owner(s), range of application, materiality, approval date, potential restrictions on the model's use (e.g. conditions), as well as the key model weaknesses and change versioning. The register should also include models purchased from third-party vendors."
"7. Adequate controls of the register of the institution's internal models, together with an inventory of the documentation, including an annual review, should be in place. This includes a policy for document management that clearly states the roles and responsibilities involved in approving documents, as well as how changes in documentation are applied and communicated internally. In addition, the institution should have a policy regarding the adequate archiving and maintenance of information, access permissions and the assessment of the completeness and consistency of the information held."
"8. Documentation should be kept up-to-date and the institution should keep documents for an appropriate period of time, taking into account legal or regulatory retention periods."
1.4 Implementation of a model risk management framework
"9. Effective model risk management allows institutions to reduce the risk of potential losses and underestimation of own funds requirements as a result of flaws in the development, implementation or use of the models. To mitigate these risks, institutions should have a model risk management framework 7 in place that allows them to identify, understand and manage their model risk for internal models across the group. This framework should comprise, at least, the following. (a) A written model risk management policy. This policy should, as a minimum, include a concept or a definition of what constitutes a model, provide the institution's interpretation of model risk 8 and describe the model risk framework with reference to its different components (e.g. model governance, risk control function, validation function, internal audit) and their related documented policies. (b) A register of the institution's internal models, as described in paragraph 6. This register should facilitate a holistic understanding of the application and use of the models and provide the institution's management body and senior management with a comprehensive overview of the models in place. (c) Guidelines on identifying and mitigating any areas where measurement uncertainty and model deficiencies are known to exist, according to their materiality. In particular, those elements that relate to qualitative aspects of model risk (such as data deficiencies, model misuse or implementation errors) should be considered. This methodology should be applied consistently across the group (e.g. in subsidiaries or regions). (d) Guidelines and methodologies for the qualitative and/or quantitative assessment and measurement 9 of the institution's model risk. (e) Guidelines with respect to the model life cycle as set out in paragraph 2. (f) Procedures for model risk communication and reporting (internal and external). (g) Definition of roles and responsibilities within the model risk management framework (e.g. define which unit(s) is/are in charge of or involved in independent reviews of risk estimates)."
1.5 Identification of management body and senior management
"10. Institutions should clearly define the roles and responsibilities of their management body and senior management as defined in Article 3(1) subparagraphs (7) and (9) of CRD IV, as implemented in the relevant national law with regard to internal models and in relation to each risk type. The institution's internal documentation should also clearly describe the composition of the management body and the senior management."
"11. The term ""management body"" could refer to the single board, in a one-tier system, or to the function of the management and supervisory boards in a twotier corporate governance system. The institution should document the roles and responsibilities of each individual in the management body. For the purposes of this guide, the management body refers to the members of the management body in its management function (executive members)."
"12. The institution should assess the appropriateness of designated committees of the management body (if applicable) in order to ensure that they provide an adequate support function for effective decision-making procedures. This holds, in particular, for decisions concerning material aspects of the institution's internal models. The institution should clearly document the composition, mandate and reporting lines of committees responsible for internal model governance and oversight, as well as the decisions taken. These committees should be given a mandate by the management body; the mandate should clearly define their tasks and authority. In order for the designated committee to be set at an appropriate level, it should be chaired by a member of the management body."
"13. The institution should also be able to identify which individuals constitute its senior management with respect to the credit, market and counterparty credit risk Pillar I model frameworks. In addition to the specifications of Article 3(1) sub-paragraphs (7) and (9) of CRD IV, senior management can be deemed to constitute the highest hierarchical level(s) below the management body with a clearly defined responsibility for internal models. 10 The senior management should either report directly to the management body or be responsible for providing it with the necessary information to carry out its duties, especially with regard to its oversight role. The senior management's decision-making procedures relating to all aspects of internal models should be clearly documented."
1.6 General principles for internal validation
"14. All internal models and internal estimates should be subject to an initial, and subsequently to an annual, internal validation. For the avoidance of doubt, the term ""initial validation"" in the guide refers to the validation of new models as well as the validation of material changes and extensions to approved models."
"15. To ensure the effective independence of the internal validation function from the model development process (i.e. model design, development, implementation and monitoring), institutions should have appropriate organisational arrangements in place. The ECB understands that the possible organisational arrangements are as follows: 11 (a) separation into two different units reporting to different members of the senior management; (b) separation into two different units reporting to the same member of the senior management; (c) separate staff within the same unit. The decision on which organisational arrangement to adopt should take into account the nature, size and scale of the institution and the complexity of the risks inherent in its business model."
"16. Consequently, the ECB understands that large and complex institutions should implement the most robust independence option."
"17. With option (b) of paragraph 15, two different units report directly 12 to the same member of senior management, but act separately at any level below that. When using this second option, the ECB considers that it is good practice if the institution fulfils the additional requirements specified in Article 10(3) of the Final Draft RTS on assessment methodology for IRB and Article 22(1)(e) of the Final Draft RTS on assessment methodology for IMA and significant share. The internal audit should regularly assess whether these additional requirements are being met."
"18. The ECB considers that option (c) of paragraph 15 could be suitable for small legal entities which are not classified as global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) or other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs). 13 When using this option, the ECB considers that it is good practice if the institution fulfils the additional requirements specified in Article 10(4) of the Final Draft RTS on assessment methodology for IRB and Article 22(2) of the Final Draft RTS on assessment methodology for IMA and significant share, and in particular that the internal audit regularly assesses that these additional requirements are met."
"19. A proper separation of the staff of the development function from the staff of the validation function enables institutions to limit the risk of conflicts of interest resulting in an ineffective challenge from the validation. To mitigate this risk, the institution should ensure that the staff of the validation function is separate from the staff involved in the model development process. 14"
"20. The validation function 15 should be adequately staffed following the proportionality principle. It should have suitable resources and experienced, 16 qualified personnel (who have appropriate quantitative and qualitative knowledge) to enable it to conduct an effective independent challenge of the internal models and internal estimates and their performance."
1.7 General principles for internal audit
"21. The CRR requires internal models to be subject to regular review by the internal audit or another comparable independent auditing unit (hereinafter internal audit). 17 In the understanding of the ECB, also taking into account the EBA Guidelines on internal governance 18, this regular review needs to be efficient and effective to meet that objective."
"22. To enable an objective assessment, the internal audit should be granted an adequate level of independence from the processes and units reviewed to ensure that: (a) there is an effective separation of the internal audit from the staff involved in the operations of the internal models, e.g. the validation function, the risk control unit and all other relevant business areas; (b) it reports directly to the management body 19; (c) no undue influence is exerted on the staff responsible for the audit conclusions."
"23. To enable a sufficient number and adequate scope of internal model reviews the internal audit should: (a) have adequate resources 20 and experienced, qualified personnel (with the appropriate quantitative and qualitative knowledge) to undertake all relevant activities; (b) be adequately equipped and managed in proportion to the nature, size and degree of complexity of the institution's business and organisational structure."
"24. In the follow-up process to the internal audit conclusions and findings and to ensure that the internal audit reviews have a timely and effective impact, the following are considered to be good practice. (a) Conclusions, findings and recommendations should be reported to the audit committee 21 and/or the appropriate 22 management level of the audited areas. (b) Where weaknesses are identified, action plans and related measures should be approved by the audit committee and/or the appropriate24 management level of the audited areas. The internal audit function should monitor whether the audited areas implement the corrective measures in a timely manner. The institution should use appropriate information technology (IT) tools in order to ensure the effectiveness of the monitoring procedures. (c) Regular (at least annual) status reports should be prepared and the results discussed in the appropriate committees to ensure the timely and proper implementation of follow-up actions. Institutions should submit a summary of the outcomes of the relevant audit reports, action plans and the status of findings to the competent authority."
2 Roll-out and permanent partial use
2.1 Relevant regulatory references
2.2 Application of the IRB approach
"25. In accordance with Article 148 of the CRR, institutions must implement the IRB approach for all exposures, unless they have received the permission of the competent authority to permanently use the standardised approach on some exposure classes or some types of exposures."
"26. The criteria used to define the scope of application and sequential implementation of the IRB approach should be clearly documented and agreed with the competent authority. The ECB understands that these criteria include the following. (a) Quantitative aspects: as a minimum, the materiality and risk profile of the exposures and internal thresholds/ratios (for both exposure at default (EAD) value and risk-weighted exposure amounts (RWEAs)) for the initial and targeted IRB coverage. For institutions for which the ECB is the competent authority of the consolidated entity, the initial IRB coverage ratio (rating systems included in the initial IRB application) is expected to be above 50% (in terms of both EAD and RWEAs 26) at consolidated level. This takes into account that institutions must implement the IRB approach for all exposures included in the roll-out plan in a reasonable time period. 27 (b) Qualitative aspects: importance of the exposure classes or types of exposures for the institution's business model, data availability, operational capacity, staffing, length of experience and homogeneity of treatment of similar exposures."
27. Institutions which have already received permission to use the IRB approach are also expected to reach a 50% minimum IRB coverage ratio (in terms of both EAD and RWEAs) in the implementation of the approved roll-out plan.
"28. The IRB approach can be implemented sequentially across the different exposure classes or types of exposures, across different business units or for the use of own estimates of losses given default (LGDs) and conversion factors (CCFs) (roll-out). The ECB considers that the time frame for the initially approved roll-out plan should generally not exceed five years. 28"
"29. In the light of the ECB's need to know the regulatory treatment of all exposures for its ongoing supervision, institutions are expected to provide the competent authority with full transparency and regular communications regarding this treatment. 29 These communications should include information on all subsidiaries and all portfolios (together with clear exposure assignment criteria). Institutions should receive explicit permission from the competent authority to use the standardised approach for exposure classes or types of exposures that are not in the scope of the IRB approach, following the requirements established under Article 150 of the CRR."
"30. Decisions of the institutions on the application and sequential implementation of the IRB approach should be triggered by internal criteria (as defined in paragraph 26) with the main purpose of enhancing risk management and risk sensitivity. In particular, sequential implementation should not be selectively used for the purpose of achieving reduced own funds requirements. 30"
2.3 Governance of the roll-out plan for the IRB approach
"31. ""All material aspects of the rating and estimation processes shall be approved by the institution's management body or a designated committee thereof and senior management."" 31 As the roll-out plan determines the intended application of the IRB approach and its sequential implementation, it too should be approved by the institution's senior management and management body (or a designated committee thereof)."
"32. As a corollary and in accordance with Article 189(2)(a) of the CRR, the ECB understands that the reporting by senior management on the status and progress of the sequential implementation of the IRB approach should be a regular agenda item for the management body or designated committee. The ECB would consider the following to be good practice: that the status of the rollout plan is reported frequently (at least annually) and that such reports include the exact scope of application (exposure class), the planned dates of approval and/or use, and the ""initial, current and planned"" 32 exposure amounts and RWEAs."
"33. To ensure compliance with Article 189(1) of the CRR with respect to the roll-out plan, institutions should have a framework or policy for the governance of their roll-out plan that includes, as mentioned above, the following: (a) indication of which internal bodies, including the management body or other committees and persons, are responsible for approving the roll-out plan and any changes to it; (b) the frequency of reporting on the implementation of the roll-out plan to the management body (or designated committee) and to the competent authority; (c) the criteria used for introducing changes to the roll-out plan (see also Section 2.4, below); (d) controls to assess compliance with the roll-out plan, for example second line of defence attestation or internal audit review (see also paragraph 79)."
2.4 Changes to the roll-out plan for the IRB approach
"34. Under Article 148(2) of the CRR, institutions are required to follow the roll-out plan approved by the competent authorities. In the event that a change in the approved roll-out plan is necessary, this change needs to be subject to a supervisory decision."
"35. Article 7(3) of the Final Draft RTS on assessment methodology for IRB 33 provides a good understanding of the conditions under which competent authorities may approve any changes to the sequence and time period of the plan. The ECB intends to assess any application for a change to a roll-out plan against these conditions, on the basis of the documentation provided by the institution regarding the rationale for the change, the materiality of the portfolios affected, and governance arrangements for the change (e.g. which body will approve it). In addition, when assessing an application for a change to the rollout plan, the competent authority will determine, if necessary, whether the proposed amendment to the time frame for the implementation of the roll-out plan is acceptable. If institutions have already completed the implementation of their roll-out plan but would like to extend the use of the IRB approach (for instance following a merger or acquisition), they should also seek approval 34 from the competent authority."
"36. Furthermore, institutions should pay attention to the following. (a) Resource constraints and re-prioritisation may affect their operational capability to develop and maintain rating systems. Institutions should seek to minimise disruptions to the implementation of the roll-out plan as a result of such factors, taking appropriate mitigation or contingency actions to demonstrate compliance with the CRR requirements. (b) General uncertainty caused by potential changes to the IRB regulatory requirements should not be considered a valid reason for changing the roll-out plan (or for delaying its implementation). If such regulatory changes take place and become binding, the institution can then reflect the impact on its plan by submitting a revised roll-out plan for approval."
2.5 Monitoring of compliance with permanent partial use provisions
"37. Since permanent partial use (PPU) requires compliance with certain conditions, institutions need to ensure on an ongoing basis that exposures under PPU fall within the categories listed in Article 150(1) of the CRR. To avoid a risk of non-compliance with these requirements, the ECB is of the view that institutions should implement the following. (a) Measures and triggers for a re-assessment of the suitability for PPU of PPU-authorised exposure classes or types of exposures. Examples of measures that could be used include the number of obligors, EAD, proportion of group EAD, and average risk weight. (b) A reporting process monitoring the materiality (in terms of both EAD and RWEAs) of the exposure classes or types of exposures in PPU over time. The PPU reporting should identify any changes in PPU exposures and RWEAs over time as well as the exposure classes or types of exposures that are at risk of no longer fulfilling the PPU conditions. (c) Processes and guidelines to assess whether further exposure classes or types of exposure - currently treated under the IRB approach - may become eligible for PPU (e.g. business in run-off or planned to be discontinued, excessive maintenance costs induced by the regulatory requirements vis-a-vis number of obligors)."

3 Internal governance
3.1 Relevant regulatory references
"38. The principles on internal governance have been organised along the following lines: (a) the materiality of rating systems (Section 3.2); (b) the management body and senior management: (i) 36 decision-making responsibilities (Section 3.3); Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ""Guidelines: Corporate governance principles for banks"", referred to in this guide as ""Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) 328"". (ii) internal reporting (Section 3.4); (iii) understanding of the rating systems (Section 3.5); (c) responsibilities of the credit risk control unit (CRCU) (Section 3.6)."

3.2 Materiality of rating systems
"39. Whether a rating system is material depends on quantitative criteria (such as the share of total EAD and RWEA covered by the material rating systems) and qualitative criteria (such as the type, riskiness and strategic importance of the exposures, the complexity of the rating systems and risk parameters, and the model risk ?€? in alignment with the model risk management framework). The more material a rating system is, the higher are the risks resulting from any potential shortcomings in it. Consequently, materiality should be an essential consideration in model risk management and the rating systems classified as material by the institution should be subject to particular scrutiny."
"40. In line with the above, institutions should assess and determine the materiality of their rating systems and communicate it to the competent authority. Material rating systems should at least include the rating systems covering material types of exposure. As the classification of the rating systems according to their materiality may be subject to changes resulting from internal or external factors (e.g. changes in economic factors, changes in business strategy), institutions should review their classification on a regular basis."
"41. Although the same requirements apply to all rating systems throughout the model life cycle, additional requirements may apply to material rating systems, in particular with regard to internal reporting (see Section 3.4 of this chapter) and internal validation (see Section 4.3 of this chapter). This concept, that additional requirements may apply for material rating systems, is supported by the higher potential risk resulting from material rating systems and by Article 189 of the CRR, which also embeds the concept of materiality."
3.3 Decision-making responsibilities
"42. In accordance with Article 189(1) of the CRR, material aspects of all rating and estimation processes must be approved by the institution's management body or a committee designated by it, as well as by senior management. The ECB considers that Article 14(b) of the Final Draft RTS on assessment methodology for IRB provides a good understanding of the aspects that should at least be considered as material, and should therefore be approved at both levels."
"43. The ECB understands that the approval process envisaged by Article 189(1) of the CRR should include the documentation of the approvals, so that they can be made available for review at the request of the institution's internal audit or the competent authority."
"44. The institution should define which policies should be approved at both levels (management body and senior management) and this should be clarified in their respective mandates. At a minimum, the following should be considered as requiring approval at both levels: (i) risk management policies that could have a material impact on the institution's rating systems and risk estimates, and (ii) policies covering the risk of a third-party provider for model-related tasks ceasing to operate (in relation to IT infrastructure and contingency planning)."
"45. Senior management must provide notice to the management body or a designated committee thereof of material changes or exceptions from established policies. Consequently, institutions should be able to demonstrate which material changes or exceptions from established policies are communicated to the management body or a committee designated by it, and how this is done. To ensure compliance with this provision each institution should, in the ECB's view, have a policy in place which defines material changes or exceptions. They may use quantitative and/or qualitative criteria to do so. The use of expert judgement within the classification process should be clearly explained and documented."
3.4 Internal reporting
"46. To ensure consistent oversight of the functioning of the rating systems, the CRR requires internal reporting on their performance. "
"47. To comply with this reporting requirement, institutions should determine the level of detail of the information and data to be presented to senior management and the management body (or designated committee thereof), and the frequency of the reporting. In view of proportionality, the level of detail of the information and data and the frequency of reporting may differ depending on the recipient and the materiality of the rating systems concerned (see Section 3.2 of this chapter on the materiality of rating systems). Reports regarding non-material rating systems may be provided in a more aggregated form. The procedures encompassing reporting for non-material rating systems should be clearly defined in the institution's policies and differences with respect to the reporting of material rating systems should be clearly identified."
48. The ECB considers that Article 15 of the Final Draft RTS on assessment methodology for IRB provides a good understanding of the elements to be
"included as part of the institution's internal reporting. 42 In particular, these reports should include information regarding the materiality of each rating system, its perceived strengths and limitations, and its current status in the light of validation and/or audit actions."
"49. As regards the level of detail of content, reports to the management body are expected to be more concise than reports to senior management. They should, however, include the necessary information for sound and appropriate decisionmaking. As regards frequency, institutions should provide reports to senior management as often as, or more frequently than, to the management body (or designated committee). Risk profiles and the comparison of estimated probability of default (PD) with realised default rates should be reported to senior management more frequently than annually (at least for material rating systems - see also paragraph 41) to enable senior management to ensure, on an ongoing basis, that the rating systems are operating properly in accordance with Article 189(2)(c) of the CRR and to avoid risks that could justify supervisory measures."
"50. At least annually, both senior management and the management body should receive an aggregated overview of the validation results for each rating system (see also paragraph 69)."
3.5 Understanding of the rating systems
"51. The management body must possess a general understanding of the rating systems and senior management must have a good understanding of the rating systems designs and operations. 43 Institutions should therefore be able to provide evidence of the processes they use to improve and maintain the management body and senior management's understanding of the rating systems, including those implemented after receiving permission to use the IRB approach."

"52. The format and content of these processes (for example workshops, seminars or dedicated training on IRB models) should match the roles and responsibilities of the management body and senior management, in particular those related to the model approval process. Especially for the management body, an adequate balance between collective and individual knowledge should be ensured. In the case of third-party involvement (see Section 8 of this chapter), the institution should maintain adequate internal knowledge of the outsourced tasks."
"53. While reporting or monitoring can be considered as part of the management body and senior management's knowledge-building process, it is expected that these will not be the only means of ensuring that they have an adequate understanding of the rating systems."
"54. One outcome of an effective internal understanding of the rating system is that the management body or the designated committee should be able to hold an objective debate on, and challenge, the rating systems. This applies in particular to the approval of material changes or the escalation process contemplated in paragraph 71. In the ECB's view, it is good practice if the evidence of such debates is visible in the minutes of management body or designated committee meetings in which such a challenge is raised, as the management body or the designated committee should be able to discuss the outcomes, use, strengths and limitations of the IRB models."
3.6 The credit risk control unit (CRCU)
"55. To ensure that the CRCU is independent from the personnel and management functions responsible for originating and renewing exposures, 44 institutions should clearly determine which individuals and/or teams make up the credit risk control function and which personnel and/or units are responsible for originating and renewing exposures, 45 and why they are independent from one another. In addition, institutions need to ensure a direct line of reporting of the CRCU to senior management in accordance with Article 190(1) of the CRR."
"56. Institutions should have a clear written mandate for their CRCU which clarifies its roles and responsibilities in order to ensure that they are aligned to the responsibilities mentioned in Article 190(2) of the CRR. Institutions should also determine which units are responsible for performing which subset of the tasks allocated to the CRCU(s), 46 especially those tasks related to model design and development and the ongoing monitoring of the rating systems."
"57. The CRCU is responsible for ensuring the satisfactory performance of the rating systems and their ongoing maintenance. The CRCU may provide the validation function, when required and in line with paragraph 65, with the necessary input for the validation of internal estimates. In addition, the CRCU should address any deficiencies identified by the validation function and conduct the approved remediation activities as described in paragraph 70."
3.7 Review of estimates
"58. In accordance with Article 179(1)(c) of the CRR, risk estimates should be reviewed 47 when new information comes to light but at least on an annual basis. The ECB considers it good practice to do this on the basis of: a) the ongoing monitoring performed by the CRCU; b) the annual validation of internal estimates performed by the validation function (as described in Section 4 of this chapter)."
4 Internal validation
4.1 Relevant regulatory references
"59. In the context of rating systems, the term ""validation"" encompasses a range of processes and activities that contribute to an assessment of whether ratings adequately differentiate risk, and whether estimates of risk parameters (such as PD, LGD and CCF) appropriately characterise the relevant aspects of risk."
"60. The main role of the validation function is to perform a consistent and meaningful assessment of the performance of internal rating and risk estimation systems. The term ""validation function"" encompasses the personnel responsible for performing the validation."
4.2 Validation level and responsibilities
"61. In general, internal validation should be performed at all relevant levels. In particular, institutions should pay attention to the following. (a) If the institution has approval for a rating system on a consolidated basis only, the validation of that rating system should be performed at least at consolidated level. (b) If the institution has approval for a rating system on a consolidated basis as well as on a sub-consolidated and/or individual basis, the validation of that rating system should be performed at the consolidated as well as on the sub-consolidated and/or individual levels. The results of the validation at the sub-consolidated and/or individual levels should be taken into account for consistency reasons in the validation performed at consolidated level."

"62. In order to ensure consistency in validation activities across the different levels, the group validation function can provide support to validation functions at lower levels (sub-consolidated and/or individual level). However, responsibility for the validation tasks should be retained at the level at which the rating system is approved (sub-consolidated and/or individual level). See also Section 8.3.1 on internal and external outsourcing of internal validation and internal audit tasks and Section 8.3.5 on in-house knowledge of this chapter."
4.3 Content and frequency of tasks of the validation function
"63. To meet the requirements of Article 185 of the CRR with regard to the assessment of the performance of the internal rating and risk estimates by the validation function, the ECB understands that institutions should implement the following."
"64. Validation policy Institutions should have internal validation policies involving proven procedures and methods which adequately validate the accuracy, robustness and stability of their estimation of all relevant risk parameters. 50 The procedures and methods stipulated in the validation policy should be in line with the institution's classification of material and non-material rating systems as defined in paragraphs 39 and 41. Institutions should follow their internal validation policy when carrying out validations."
"65. Validation process and content: 50 (a) The validation process should assess the performance of the rating systems by means of qualitative and quantitative methods, in particular with regard to the ranking of borrowers by creditworthiness (ranking power) and risk parameter estimation (calibration appropriateness). (b) To be able to meaningfully and consistently assess the performance of the rating systems, the content of the validation process should be consistent across rating systems and through time. 51 The analyses and tests described in this paragraph should be considered as the minimum activities required to ensure that the assessment is meaningful. However, the implementation of all of these analyses and tests does not necessarily mean that the validation requirements according to CRR have been fulfilled, nor should it prevent the institution from developing additional tests when deemed relevant. (c) The content of the validation process should include quantitative analyses, which in turn should include thresholds. If such thresholds are breached, further investigation should be initiated and, if necessary, adequate measures or actions should be triggered. (d) All analyses and tests should be performed in such a way that the validation function is in a position to propose an effective and independent challenge to model development and use. To that end, the institution should ensure that the validation function has its own access to the relevant databases. 52 The results of the validation analyses and tests should be documented (validation report) and verifiable by third-party experts (e.g. the internal audit and the competent authority). This also includes the preparation of the validation data. (e) It is not expected that institutions develop a uniform validation process, as the relevant tests and their frequency may differ from one rating system to another (e.g. corporate vs. retail rating systems or material vs. nonmaterial rating systems). (f) To ensure that the systems in place to validate the accuracy and consistency of rating systems are sufficiently robust, 53 institutions should ensure that any statistical tests or confidence intervals that they use are appropriate from a methodological point of view and sufficiently conservative. (g) A meaningful validation of the rating systems requires (as also anticipated by Article 185(b) of the CRR with respect to certain elements) not only an initial validation but also assessment on a regular basis. In line with Article 185(b) of the CRR, these assessments should be carried out annually. 54 Therefore, the validation analyses listed hereinafter should be carried out annually, unless otherwise advised below. As mentioned in paragraph 14 the term ""initial validation"" in the guide refers to the validation of new models as well as the validation of material changes and extensions to approved models. In the case of material changes and extensions the validation should be conducted on those aspects directly or indirectly affected by the change. 55 (h) In addition, and to ensure a robust validation, the analyses should be performed by the validation function without considering input from the CRCU 56 unless otherwise specified below. (i) Back-testing 57 For the annual validation of non-material rating systems, the validation function can also take into account the back-testing analyses performed by the CRCU. (ii) Discriminatory power (ii.a) Analyses of discriminatory power for PD models should be designed to ensure that the ranking of obligors/facilities resulting from the rating methodology appropriately separates riskier and less risky obligors/facilities. 58 Similarly, analyses of discriminatory power for LGD (respective CCF) models should be designed to ensure that the LGD (respective CCF) model is able to discriminate between facilities with high values of LGD (respective CCF) and those with low values of LGD (respective CCF). (ii.b) These analyses should be performed at least at the level of the overall model and, when relevant, at the level of individual risk factors and other possible segments including, for example, scorecards and modules. (ii.c) For the annual validation of non-material rating systems, the validation function can also take into account the analyses of discriminatory power performed by the CRCU. (iii) Analyses of representativeness (iii.a) The data used to build the model must be representative of the actual obligors or exposures (Article 174(c) of the CRR). This should include the following checks. - Ensuring that the range of application of the model is in line with the approved one, in accordance with Article 143(3) of the CRR. Obligor characteristics should be compared for PD models, and facility types and characteristics should be compared for LGD and CCF models. - Monitoring the modifications undertaken in the definition of default, with the aim of identifying any changes that would affect the representativeness of the dataset with respect to the obligors or facilities within the range of application of the model. Analysing lending standards or workout procedures, external market and economic conditions, and other relevant characteristics surrounding the model development process. (iii.b) Where an institution uses data that are pooled across institutions, the analyses should also cover the requirements of Article 179(2) paragraphs (a) and (b) of the CRR. (iii.c) For the annual validation of rating systems, the validation function can also take into account the analyses of representativeness performed by the CRCU. (iv) Analyses of overrides (iv.a) Overrides should not only be monitored but also assessed as part of the validation process (Article 172(3) of the CRR). See also Section 6.6.2 of this chapter. (iv.b) Analyses of overrides should be conducted on an annual basis (and not at initial validation). The validation function can also take into account the analyses of overrides performed by the CRCU. (v) Stability analyses of the internal ratings and risk parameters over time 59 (v.a) (v.b) (v.c) For the annual validation of non-material rating systems, the validation function can also take into account the stability analyses performed by the CRCU. (vi) Analyses of model design stability 60 (vi.a) The institution should analyse: ?€? the differences between the original weights of the risk drivers (derived from the development sample) and the weights estimated from a different sample (longer or more recent historical sample); ?€? the continued homogeneity61 of rating grades or pools used as a basis for the estimation of risk parameters. (vi.b) Institutions should justify excessive or unexpected variability. (vi.c) These analyses should be performed at initial validation and at an adequate frequency thereafter, but at least every three years. The validation function can also take into account the analyses performed by the CRCU for non-material rating systems, except at initial validation. (vii) Evaluation of input data 62 (vii.a) This should ensure all of the following: ?€? that the data treatment process is reliable and wellfounded; ?€? that the necessary information is available and up-to-date for the majority of the application portfolio's 63 obligors and facilities by tracking the age of model input data, especially in the case of financial statements; ?€? that all defaults that occurred in the institution within the scope of application of the model are correctly identified and fully documented and registered in the appropriate and intended IT systems; ?€? that the number and reasons for technical past-due situations are tracked. (vii.b) For the annual validation of the rating systems, the validation function can also take into account the evaluation of the input data performed by the CRCU. (viii) Benchmarking analyses (viii.a) The institution should carry out comparisons with up-to-date data from representative and comparable external data sources, in particular with regard to low-default portfolios (Article 185(c) of the CRR). The institution should provide sufficient evidence in the event that no usable external data are available. (viii.b) Benchmarking analyses should be performed at initial validation and at an adequate frequency thereafter, but at least every three years. For benchmarking analyses at initial validation the validation function can take into account the benchmarking analyses performed by the CRCU. (ix) Data cleansing analyses 64 (ix.a) These analyses refer to the exclusion of observations (and the reasons behind this) from the risk database for the construction of the reference dataset (RDS) for the modelling. (ix.b) These analyses should be performed at least at initial validation. (x) Review of the model specification (x.a) This analysis should include challenging the model design, assumptions and methodology. A stepwise initial validation process involving interaction with the model development at each step of the development phase may not be sufficient to perform this challenge effectively. Regardless of the validation approach followed, the validation unit should provide an overall conclusion on the model to ensure that individual model strengths and weaknesses are evaluated on an overall basis. (x.b) This analysis should be performed at least at initial validation. (xi) Quality assurance of the computer codes used (xi.a) This should include at least the following: that the descriptions of the data sources, variables and risk drivers used for development purposes are properly documented. (xi.b) These analyses should be performed at least at initial validation. (xii) Additional qualitative analyses 66 These analyses should include, among other things, the following: ?€? qualitative assessments of assumptions and expert-based estimates and of the integrity of the rating assignment process; ?€? assessment of the use of the models and their correct application in practice; ?€? assessment of legal or macroeconomic changes that may impact the risk parameters; ?€? assessment of downturn phases and the correct application of margins of conservatism. Not all of the above-mentioned qualitative analyses need to be performed annually, but institutions should have a clear policy in place defining the appropriate frequency of each assessment."






66. The duration from the start (reference date of data) to the end (approval of the validation results) of the yearly validation should not be more than one year. Deviations from this requirement should be clearly justified and documented by the institution and also reported to senior management.
67. Quantitative thresholds (see paragraph 65(c)) should be set up for at least the following tests: (a) back-testing; (b) discriminatory power; (c) analyses of overrides; (d) stability analyses of the internal ratings and risk parameters over time.
"68. In particular for tests where no thresholds are applied, a consistent qualitative assessment of the results should be performed and documented. In the event of a negative qualitative assessment, adequate measures or actions should be triggered."
4.4 Reporting and follow-up
"69. Institutions should ensure that senior management and the management body (or the committee designated by it) are informed about the conclusions and recommendations of the validation results as set out in the rating systems' validation reports, and in particular about any exceeded thresholds and deficiencies identified, as this is required by Article 189(2)2 of the CRR. Such information should be provided, where appropriate, 67 in a summary document (or documents) to ensure that a sufficient level of information is provided to senior management and to the management body and to enable them to assess the performance of the rating systems. This summary document (or documents) should present an aggregated view and comparison of the results for all the rating systems."
"70. Institutions should be able to demonstrate that, on the basis of the validation results and recommendations, measures are initiated to remedy the identified deficiencies of the rating systems (e.g. model change, recalibration) as contemplated by Article 189(2), sub-paragraph 2, of the CRR."
"71. Article 189(2)(c) of the CRR requires senior management to ensure, on an ongoing basis, that the rating systems are operating properly. Article 189(2)2 requires senior management to be informed of the status of the measures to remedy any previously identified deficiencies. From this, it can be inferred that institutions should have a process in place (e.g. through a committee or another comparable body) to decide on such measures, who will be responsible for them, and the timelines for their implementation, on the basis of the validation results and recommendations. To ensure sufficient senior management engagement as contemplated by Article 189(2) of the CRR, the ECB is of the view that at least for material rating systems the direct involvement of senior management should be envisaged (e.g. by senior management chairing the committee). The process should involve persons with the appropriate level of seniority and responsibility from both the CRCU and the validation function. If affected, business units should also be involved. An escalation process up to management body level should be in place in the event of conflicts between the validation function, the CRCU and/or business units."
72. Institutions should have adequate processes in place for tracking the status of the measures adopted to remedy deficiencies. 68
73. Institutions should always apply to/notify the competent authority in the event of changes to their validation methodology and/or processes in accordance with Annex 1 Part 2 Section 1 (material model change) or Section 2 (ex ante notification) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014.

5 Internal audit
5.1 Relevant regulatory references
5.2 Scope and frequency of the review of the rating systems
"74. In accordance with the existing regulatory requirements under Article 191 of the CRR, the internal audit or another comparable independent auditing unit (hereinafter internal audit) must review the institution's rating systems and its operations at least annually. The areas for review must include adherence to all applicable requirements."
"75. The ECB considers that an institution fulfils the above-mentioned requirements of Article 191 of the CRR if the internal audit carries out, annually and on the basis of up-to-date information, a general risk assessment of all aspects of the rating systems for the purpose of drawing up the appropriate internal audit work plan, as elaborated in paragraphs 76 to 78, and executes this plan."
"76. Depending on the outcome of the general risk assessment, the intensity and frequency of the audit assignments 69 may differ between specific areas. (a) An area showing signs of increased/high risk in the general risk assessment is subject to a thorough audit assignment (¡°deep dive¡±). Reasons for the increased risk might include, but are not limited to, new processes, new regulatory requirements, new types of exposures in the range of application of a rating system, material model changes, findings by the competent authority or by any other function, open issues and areas with high risk identified in previous risk assessments. The audit assignments should be included in the annual audit work plan established on the basis of the general risk assessment. (b) Areas not showing any sign of an increased/high risk are subject to a deep dive mission at least every three years in order to provide a thorough update of the internal audit opinion on them. 70"

"77. For the purpose of the general risk assessment, the internal audit should develop its own opinion on the areas of rating systems to be reviewed but can take into consideration the analysis performed by the internal validation function where appropriate. This general risk assessment should include at least the opinion of the internal audit unit on the following aspects. (a) The development 71 and performance 72 of the rating systems. (b) The use of the models. The assessment of model use shows that the rating systems play an essential role in the most significant areas of the institution's risk management, decision-making, credit approval, internal capital allocation and corporate governance functions. (c) The process for the materiality classification, 73 the impact assessment and the compliance with regulatory requirements of all changes to the rating systems as well as their consequent implementation. The internal audit is informed of all changes to the rating systems. (d) The quality of the data used for the quantification of risk parameters. (e) The integrity of the rating assignment process. (f) The validation function, in particular with regard to its independence from the CRCU as described in paragraphs 17 and 18 of this chapter, as well as the scope and suitability of the tasks performed and outputs obtained. (g) The process for calculating own funds requirements."
"78. The procedures and results of the general risk assessment and prioritisation, the annual work plan, the guidelines, and the subsequent production of the internal audit reports should be properly documented and approved by the management body. The auditing techniques used and applied by the institution should be documented to ensure that assessments are consistent. 74"
"79. To avoid delays in the procedures related to an initial IRB application or an application to extend the IRB approach to an exposure class or a type of exposure that is currently treated using the standardised approach, it is beneficial if the internal audit provides the competent authority with an independent assessment of the compliance of the initial IRB application or extension package with all applicable requirements. This applies in particular to compliance with the experience test requirements of Article 145 of the CRR. The benefit of carrying out an internal review of this nature is that shortcomings can be addressed by the institution before submitting the application, and the completeness of the initial IRB application or extension package can be ensured."

"80. For extensions and changes to the IRB approach, 75 institutions must submit, among other things, reports of their independent review or validation. 76 In the case of material changes in the validation methodology and/or validation processes or process-related aspects of material changes, including changes in the definition of default, the review of those aspects should be subject to an independent assessment by the internal audit function before they are submitted to the competent authority for approval."
6 Model use
6.1 Relevant regulatory references
6.2 Use test requirement
"81. The ECB acknowledges that the degree of use of internal ratings and default and loss estimates in the institution's risk management and decision-making process, and in its credit approval, internal capital allocation and corporate governance functions, is more extensive for PD/internal ratings than for LGD/loss estimates and CCFs."
"82. Moreover, the IRB risk parameters can be used in an adjusted form or indirectly through relevant risk measures/indicators stemming from the rating systems, provided that differences from the regulatory parameters are fully justified and properly documented. 78 For example, institutions may use adjusted or transformed IRB parameters by removing certain constraints (e.g. downturn effect, conservative add-on, floor) or adjusting the time horizon."

"83. The use of IRB risk parameters and their inclusion in internal policies and procedures enables institutions to continuously improve their accuracy and reliability by receiving feedback from model users. The conditions for an effective and beneficial feedback loop include a good understanding of the model, its assumptions and constraints and an adequate level of interaction between users, the CRCU and the validation function."
"6.3 Risk management, credit approval and decision-making process"
"84. As set out in Article 144(1)(b) of the CRR, internal ratings and default and loss estimates produced by the rating systems must play an essential role in the risk management and decision-making process and in credit approval. To ensure that they are able to play this essential role, institutions should use internal ratings and default and loss estimates in the approval, restructuring and renewal of credit facilities, and in lending policies and the monitoring process for obligors and exposures. This should be formally included in the institution's internal policies. (a) Credit approval The ECB considers that institutions comply with the requirement to use the internal ratings and default and loss estimates in the approval, restructuring and renewal of credit facilities if they establish the following. (i) Institutions incorporate the internal rating systems in the overall credit granting, restructuring and renewal process. Related policies are calibrated on the basis of rating classes or groups of rating classes or risk parameters. (ii) For the incorporation of internal rating systems to be beneficial, staff involved in the credit granting, restructuring and renewal process need to have sufficient knowledge of the rating systems, including their strengths and limitations. This encompasses the inclusion of rating system users' feedback in model development and maintenance as well as having appropriate training programmes in place. (iii) The assignment or updating of ratings is a prerequisite for the assessment underlying the granting and reviewing of credit lines. The ECB considers that institutions comply with the requirement to use the internal ratings and default and loss estimates in their lending policies, including exposure limits and mitigation techniques, if those policies have the following features. (iv) Lending policies include specific references to the use of internal rating systems and related parameters (for instance, use of a grid of parameters in the decision-making process). These parameters serve as an indicator of riskiness (e.g. in terms of expected loss (EL)). They may be differentiated by institutions' portfolios (e.g. retail/non-retail) and by facility type. (b) Risk management - monitoring process for obligors and exposures The ECB considers that institutions comply with the requirement to use their internal ratings and default and loss estimates in respect of the monitoring process for obligors and exposures if the following is established. Individuals in charge of the monitoring process are promptly provided with adequate information on the development of counterparties' credit risk as expressed by ratings, so that the relevant information can be easily incorporated in the process and trigger appropriate actions."


"85. ?In addition, institutions should consider taking into account the internal ratings and default and loss estimates produced by the rating systems in the five areas shown below. If an institution decides to take into account the internal ratings and default and loss estimates in any of these five areas, this should be formally included in its internal policies. 79 If an institution is not using internal ratings or risk parameters in one or several of these areas, it should properly document and justify the rationale for that to ensure that discrepancies are explained in a sound and understandable manner. (a) (b) Pricing of transactions (i) Internal ratings and risk estimates can be considered in the pricing of transactions, in particular for non-retail exposures. (ii) The methodology underlying pricing can be documented and the use of risk-adjusted performance indicators (e.g. return on risk-adjusted capital ?€? RORAC) or adjusted IRB parameters is considered as good practice for pricing estimation. (b) Early warning systems (i)(ii) (c) (d) Collection and recovery policies and processes (i) Regarding the collection process, institutions can have risk management procedures in place which are triggered in advance of the exposure's default (e.g. early collection calls) and are based ?€? among other indicators ?€? on their internal ratings or risk drivers. (ii) Regarding the recovery process, institutions can have in place rules, strategies or procedures that take into consideration, inter alia, their LGD/expected loss best estimate (ELBE) values, as well as their setaside provisions. Credit risk adjustments (i) €"
6.4 Internal capital assessment and allocation




"86. Internal ratings and the default and loss estimates produced by the rating systems play an important role in the assessment, calculation and allocation of institutions' internal capital 80 under the framework of the internal capital adequacy assessment process (RWEAs can also be used as an additional driver). This role should be reflected within the institutions' internal policies and procedures on internal capital assessment and allocation."

6.5 Corporate governance functions
"87. Internal ratings and the default and loss estimates produced by the rating systems play an important role in the institution's corporate governance functions. 81 To ensure that they are able to play this essential role, institutions should use internal ratings and default and loss estimates, in particular in their internal reporting and portfolio credit risk monitoring procedures. This role should be reflected within the institutions' internal policies."
"88. The ECB considers that institutions comply with the requirement to use the internal ratings and default and loss estimates in their corporate governance functions if they establish the following. (a) (b) Institutions' internal reporting 82 (i) Institutions have a structured reporting system on risk measured by their IRB risk parameters. This reporting framework contains information about frequency, recipients and contents (if possible broken down by segment, portfolio and product). (ii) The reports are accompanied by comments and explanations on the numbers provided as well as by qualitative assessments, to enable recipients to fully understand the potential underlying risks. Portfolio credit risk monitoring (i) In its ongoing model monitoring function, the CRCU performs descriptive analyses of portfolio riskiness (distribution of exposures among rating classes, average risk estimates and their realisations, ELs). These analyses are progressively refined to include the analytical insights derived from the information on ratings. (ii) Reporting to senior management provides a concise but complete overview of the relevant variables 84 so that the evolution of credit risk can be monitored at portfolio level."

6.6 Assignment of exposures to grades or pools
6.6.1 Non-rated exposures and outdated ratings
"89. Article 144(1)(h) of the CRR requires institutions to assign and continue with assigning each exposure in the range of application of a rating system to a rating grade or pool of this rating system. Furthermore, and in accordance with Article 173(1)(b) of the CRR, institutions must review those assignments at least annually. Nevertheless, the ECB observes that institutions' portfolios occasionally show a certain proportion of non-rated exposures and/or outdated ratings. The ECB considers that this should be properly investigated, justified, documented and monitored. (a) (b) Root causes (i) Non-rated exposures are temporary exceptions to the ""ordinary"" rating assignment process and should therefore be investigated, documented and justified in detail. (ii) Outdated ratings include both ratings that have not been updated within the 12-month period following the last rating date 85 and ratings based on outdated information. 86 Materiality (i) Non-rated exposures and outdated ratings present a risk for institutions of not being compliant with the CRR requirements related to rating systems. To mitigate that risk, institutions should implement specific policies and procedures to identify these non-rated exposures and outdated ratings and monitor their materiality (in terms of number, EAD and RWEAs). A formal check should be carried out on these issues, at least annually, and reported to senior management. These items should also be reviewed periodically by the internal validation function."
"90. With regard to ratings not updated within the 12-month period following the most recent rating date, a transition period during which the current rating is carried forward can be considered provided all the following conditions are met: (a) the transition period begins 12 months after the date the current rating was assigned or when new material information on the obligor or exposure became available (if earlier); (b) the transition period does not exceed three months; (c) the transition period applies: (i) to wholesale exposures whose rating assignment relies on external information (e.g. financial statements), which may be available/published not exactly 12 months apart; (ii) in the presence of exceptional internal impediments that affect the timely review of the rating assignment; (d) adequate monitoring and reporting policies, together with escalation procedures, are implemented to ensure a rapid return to compliance; restrictions to credit granting or to delegation of powers for credit approval are also envisaged for those counterparties whose rating falls within the transition period; (e) conservative treatments apply after three months, as detailed in paragraph 91."

"91. All exposures within the range of application 87 of an IRB rating system must eventually be rated 88 and are not expected to be treated under the standardised approach, unless they have received the permission of the competent authority to be permanently treated under that approach in accordance with Article 150 of the CRR. 89 Non-rated exposures and outdated ratings present a risk of potential underestimation of own funds requirements. To mitigate that risk, institutions should adhere to the following guidance. (a) Institutions should have internal policies in place establishing a process to monitor and manage non-rated exposures and outdated ratings prudentially. In particular, they should be able to prove that their procedures allow for a conservative measure of risk, such as timedependent downgrading for outdated ratings and at least the application of the worst-performing rating grade for unrated exposures. 90 (b) The calibration of the prudential treatment should be validated at least annually (evidence of conservativeness)."
6.6.2 Analysis of overrides
92. For grade and pool assignments institutions must document the situations in which human judgement may override the inputs or outputs of the rating system and the personnel responsible for approving these overrides.
"93. For the purposes of this subsection, instances of overruling of internal policies and/or procedures are not considered as overrides. If institutions overrule internal policies and/or procedures, they should, as in the case of overrides, document these instances and report them to the relevant functions (e.g. CRCU, internal validation function). The functions concerned should assess the performance of the exposures affected by the overruling and its potential impact on the rating systems."
"94. As a general principle, the rating of retail exposures is less likely to be affected by an override process, given the high degree of standardisation of information processing ?€? including in qualitative terms ?€? and the small margins of discretion in the evaluation."
"95. ""For grade and pool assignments institutions shall document those situations in which human judgement may override the inputs or outputs of the assignment process."" 91 Accordingly, institutions should have documented policies that incorporate the following principles: (a) the policies include clear and exhaustive justifications for triggering the override process on the basis of pertinent and significant information for an accurate assessment of the counterparty's creditworthiness; (b) the policies define the maximum extent of overrides (in terms of, for example, maximum number of notches up 92 and maximum share of overridden exposures), also considering model/portfolio specificities; institutions should aim to be more restrictive with positive overrides than with negative ones."
"96. Institutions must document each override. 93 To this end, they should retain the quantitative and qualitative information concerning each phase of the rating process. In particular, all decisions taken throughout the process ?€? including interim ratings ?€? should be recorded, as should the reasons for any override. The information should be proportionate to the severity and extent of the override."
"97. ""Institutions shall analyse the performance of those exposures whose assignments have been overridden."" 94 To comply with this requirement, the institutions should carry out the following procedures. (a) Performance analysis of the rating systems, to assess whether the judgemental adjustments improve their discriminatory power. The analysis may be extended to all of the underlying components (modules) of the rating system. It is deemed particularly useful to measure the difference in terms of performance and impact of the ""pre-override"" and ""post-override"" stages. (b) Other analyses, including the assessment of the distribution of overrides by override root cause, i.e. if there is a situation that systematically triggers an adjustment."

"98. To mitigate the risks identified through the aforementioned analyses (paragraph 97), institutions should identify specific criteria for assessing whether or not the number of and justifications for overrides indicate significant weaknesses in the rating system and whether this is a reason to take ad hoc actions (e.g. a model change). In general, situations where there are too many overrides could be a strong indicator of weaknesses in the model (i.e. systematic and material adjustments can be the consequence of a misspecification of the model)."
7 Management of changes to the IRB approach
7.1 Relevant regulatory references
"99. Changes to a rating system's range of application or to a rating system itself are subject to approval by the competent authorities if assessed as material, or to ex ante or ex post notification if non-material."
"100. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014 requires institutions to assess and classify the materiality of changes to rating systems. To comply with these requirements in a comprehensive and consistent way, institutions should establish a policy related to changes to the IRB approach (""change policy""). In line with the above, this policy should include, in particular, detailed criteria to ensure that the classification of changes is consistent and that any arbitrage in that regard is avoided. Institutions are encouraged to share their policy with the competent authority and inform the latter about any implemented modifications to it, in order for both sides to have a common understanding of the classification process."

7.2 Content of the change policy
"101. The change policy should include provisions relating to the operationalisation of the requirements of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014 with respect to the materiality assessment, classification, impact assessment, notification and documentation of changes and extensions. 95 To that end, it should include, in particular, the following. 96 (a) Responsibilities, reporting lines and procedures for the internal approval of changes, taking into account the institution's organisational characteristics. This policy should define at least the unit(s) responsible for the assessment and classification of changes or extensions, as well as the function/committee responsible for confirming and countersigning the classification. (b) Definitions, methods and, where applicable, metrics and significance levels for the impact assessment, threshold calculation and classification of changes; in particular, the quantitative/qualitative criteria referred to in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014. In addition, as required by Annex 1, Part 2, Section 1 of the Regulation and to ensure consistency, the following should be observed: (i) the institution should specify metrics and significance levels that define the significance/materiality of changes in the distribution across rating grades produced by changes to the rating methodology (paragraph 2(d)(ii) of Annex 1, Part 2, Section 1); these metrics and significance levels should be complementary to those of Articles 4(2) and (3) and Article 5(2) of the same Regulation; (ii) the institution should specify metrics and significance levels that define the significance/materiality of rating migrations produced by changes in the rating system's assumptions on the impact of economic conditions (paragraph 2(c)); (iii) the institution should specify metrics and significance levels that define the significance/materiality of changes in the rank ordering of clients/exposures (paragraph 2(d)(i)); (iv) in its change policy, the institution should define which changes constitute a change in the fundamental methodology for estimating PDs, LGDs (including best estimate of EL) and CCFs and are considered as material in the sense of paragraph 2(f) (as opposed to the changes referred to in paragraph 2(h) of Annex 1, Part 2, Section 2); (v) 7.3 the institution's change policy should include a definition of changes in the validation methodology and/or validation processes which lead to changes in its judgement of the accuracy and consistency of the estimation of the relevant risk parameters, the rating processes or the performance of the rating systems (paragraph 4 of Section 1). (c) Procedures to identify and monitor changes, and to notify and apply to the competent authorities for permission to make such changes. In particular, institutions should establish an end-to-end process from identification to notification/application and describe how they perform the activities at each step. (d) Procedures for the implementation of changes, including their documentation; in particular, the re-rating process should be defined (if no other document is already in place)."




7.3 Notification
"102. To facilitate the process for submitting the documentation package defined under Article 8 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014, on the banking supervision website the ECB has made available to institutions standardised templates for notifying ex ante and ex post non-material changes/extensions and for submitting applications for material model changes/extensions. Institutions are invited to use these templates to facilitate the process and to ensure consistency and completeness. 97"
7.4 Classification
"103. For the reasons mentioned in paragraph 100, institutions should have processes in place which specify, in detail, that the classification of a change/extension is adequate and consistent with the classification of other changes/extensions. The institution should ensure that the classification process is not subject to any arbitrage. In line with Article 3(3) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014, ""One material extension or change shall not be split into several changes or extensions of lower materiality"". Similarly, an extension or change that requires notification before its implementation (ex ante) should not be split into several changes or extensions to produce one that is notified after implementation (ex post). Nor should several unrelated changes/extensions be combined to produce one change of lower materiality (e.g. two different model changes that affect RWEAs in opposite ways)."

"104. In accordance with Article 3(4) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014, ""in case of doubt institutions shall assign extensions and changes to the category of the highest potential materiality""."
"105. To ensure the accuracy of the impact assessment and the correctness and consistency of the resulting classification, the institution should establish a foureye principle. This means that the assessment and classification should be confirmed by a unit independent of the one responsible for the assessment and classification of the change/extension."
7.5 Impact assessment
106. The impact assessment process must fulfil the requirements of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014. It should consist of a quantitative and a qualitative assessment.
107. The quantitative assessment focuses on the impact of the change or extension on RWEAs. Before and after the change or extension the institution should calculate the difference in these amounts for credit and dilution risk associated with the range of application of the internal rating system.
"108. This quantitative impact assessment is based on the specifications of Article 4(2) and (3) and Article 5(2) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014. The institution should use transparent definitions and internal procedures. (a) The institution should document the relevant reference date on which the calculations are based. In accordance with Article 3(2)(a) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014, the institution should use the most recent data available. In the case of material change or ex ante notification the time between the reference date and the date of notification should not exceed nine months. 98 (b) The institution should give a precise definition of the range of application of the rating system applied in the calculations as referred to in Article 4(1)(c) and Article 5(1)(a)(iii) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014. It should ensure that the change to the IRB approach is directly related to exposures within the range of application of the rating system. (c) The institution should generally perform a precise impact assessment 99 (all exposures of the relevant range of application) when the rating system is automatic and does not require any human judgement of the qualitative variables (e.g. behavioural scoring). (d) If the institution applies Article 3(2)(b) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014 and performs an impact assessment based on the re-rating of a representative sample of the population (only possible for rating systems that require qualitative assessment to define the final rating/score), this sample and its relation to the population should be described in detail (number of observations/exposures, minimum/maximum exposure amount, mean/median exposure amount, first/third quartile). The representativeness of the sample should be documented. (e) If the institution applies Article 3(2)(b) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014 and performs an impact assessment based on other reliable inference methodologies, these methods should be described in detail and their reliability corroborated by qualitative and quantitative means."


"109. The qualitative assessment is based on the specifications of Article 4(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(1)(a) points (i) and (ii) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014, which refer to the Annex I of that same Regulation. The institution should thoroughly examine each of these criteria. In addition, as reported in the change policy and to ensure consistency, institutions should examine the metrics and significance levels for the impact assessment and threshold calculation (see also Section 7.2, content of the change policy)."
"110. If a criterion specified in Annex 1 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014 may be applicable a priori (and within reason) to a change or an extension and the institution's assessment concludes that this particular criterion is not fulfilled, the institution should document this conclusion in the notification."
7.5.1 User acceptance test
"111. To avoid the risk of having unexpected consequences in the use of the changed rating system (e.g. altered role of the changed rating system in the risk management of credit exposures), institutions should assess and document the impact of a material change/extension on the use of the parameters and ensure that the related internal policies and procedures for the areas described in Section 6.3 of this chapter remain relevant."
"112. In the context of rating systems which contain qualitative inputs and/or any expert judgement component, the exposures of the representative sample referred to in point (d) of paragraph 108 should be fully re-rated under the amended rating system (including the material change or extension); adherence to the entire rating assignment process should be ensured. The feedback received from users on the application of the amended rating system and on the rating results is expected to be analysed and documented."

"113. Changes or extensions that are classified as non-material do not generally require the preparation of a use test sample, unless there is evidence of a potential impact on the use of the parameters."
7.6 Re-rating process
"114. Where competent authorities have provided their permission in relation to a material extension or change, Article 3(5) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014 requires institutions to calculate their own funds requirements on the basis of this approved extension or change from the date specified in the new permission. The ECB understands that this process (i.e. the re-rating process) should be covered in the institution's change policy."
115. Re-rating refers to the computation of a rating using the changed or extended rating system and the assignment of this new rating to an obligor previously rated using the rating system as it was before the change or extension.
"116. In the context of changes or extensions that are classified as material, the change policy should ensure that the re-rating process is immediate. All former ratings and estimates should therefore be replaced by ratings and estimates calculated using the changed or extended model from the date specified in the approval decision ?€? if the conceptual design allows this. This applies, for example, to rating systems that are exclusively based on behavioural scoring or in the case of recalibration not affecting the rating process."
"117. If an immediate re-rating is not possible (for example if the rating assignment requires new manual input and human judgement), and only for non-retail rating systems, the policy should ensure the following. (a) The obligors/exposures/facilities are rated using the amended rating system within the time frame of the yearly re-rating process, i.e. within a maximum of 12 months. (b) To mitigate the risk of underestimation of own funds requirements, in the event that a material change would lead to a material increase in the RWEA (i.e. more than 10% on the range of application of the rating system subject to change), the institution should apply the RWEA impact, simulated on the basis of the representative sample. The impact thus produced is the positive difference between the simulated RWEA after the material change and the RWEA before the material change approved by the competent authority. This should be done at the first Common Reporting date after the date of implementation. For the purpose of point (b) above, the ECB would consider the following approach as the most appropriate: - apply the simulated RWEA impact until all exposures within the range of application are rated using the changed model; - remove the simulated RWEA impact linearly, i.e. 25% every quarter."


118. The re-rating process for changes/extensions that are classified as non-material may take up to one year from the date of implementation.
8 Third-party involvement
8.1 Relevant regulatory references
8.2 Preliminary principles
"119. Outsourcing, as defined in the CEBS Guidelines on Outsourcing, refers to an authorised entity's use of a third party (the ""service provider"") to perform activities that would normally be undertaken by the authorised entity itself, now or in the future. For the purposes of this section, outsourcing in the context of IRB models refers to the involvement of third parties in any IRB-related tasks, including data provisioning and the use of external data (e.g. development data, calibration data, external ratings as input for internal models, pooled data). The specific case of delegation of IRB-related tasks to different legal entities within the same group (internal outsourcing) is also considered as outsourcing and hence is subject to the expectations set out below. 101"
8.2.1 Contract requirements
"120. All outsourcing arrangements for IRB-related tasks should be subject to a formal and comprehensive contract or similar documented agreement in accordance with the proportionality principle (in the case of internal outsourcing between different entities within the same group, provisions such as service level agreements (SLAs) or other written agreements may be considered as sufficient, subject to the criticality or importance of the tasks outsourced). Outsourcing institutions should take into account the aspects set out in Guideline 8 of the CEBS Guidelines on Outsourcing when preparing written outsourcing contracts. To avoid operational risks which could hinder the performance and operations of the rating systems, outsourcing agreements should provide for the following. (a) The agreed terms do not impede the institution in performing its validation activities. (b) The agreed terms do not impede the necessary communication between the institution and the competent authorities in performing their supervisory duties. In this sense they should include: (c) (i) full and timely access for competent authorities to all information required (e.g. all of the models' development details, where an externally developed rating system is used); (ii) a requirement for the third party to provide support to the institution in the event of a request for information by the competent authority. The agreed terms should ensure that the provider gives the institution access to relevant information in order to maintain sufficient in-house knowledge. The delivery of training and workshops is considered good practice."
8.3 Third-party involvement in internal functions and tasks
8.3.1 Internal validation and internal audit tasks
"121. Although institutions are allowed to delegate some of their tasks, activities and functions to a third party, this should be done in accordance with all existing legal requirements and after due consideration of this guide, in particular the principles relating to internal validation and the internal audit included in this general topics chapter. If an institution plans to delegate certain internal validation or internal audit tasks to a third party that would perform them outside the EU, it should discuss this plan with the competent authority in advance."
122. The ECB considers that responsibility for delegated tasks should be retained by the outsourcing institution. 102 This understanding is also expressed in Guideline 2 of the CEBS Guidelines on Outsourcing.
"123. To ensure consistency in the content, quality and governance of the activities performed internally and externally, the ECB understands that the following practices in particular should be observed: (a) Reports should carry the logo and name of the institution and of the third party performing the tasks. (b) Reports should be approved by the senior management and the members of the management body (or the designated committee thereof) responsible for the function within the institution. (c) The institution should assess the quality/performance of the outsourced tasks. (d) The independence requirements set out in Section 1.6 for internal validation and Section 1.7 for internal audit of this chapter also apply to external parties. Institutions must ensure that model reviews are independent and free from any undue influence, also when performed by third parties. In this respect institutions should establish independence guidelines/policies with regard to third parties and those participating in internal model tasks equivalent to the internal guidelines and rules set internally. In particular, third parties and individuals that have performed or are currently performing model development or CRCU tasks should not perform model validation tasks within the same institution until a prudent cool-off period has elapsed. 103, 104"
8.3.2 Use of external credit risk parameters/ratings
"124. Although institutions are allowed to use external credit risk parameters as a component of their rating systems, the following practices should be observed: (a) Internal ratings and estimates methodology should also take internal information into account. 105 When institutions use external ratings or parameters, they should ensure that these are incorporated in their estimation process in an appropriate manner and adjusted in accordance with the specificities of the institution. (b) Analogously to the requirements for data pooled across institutions, 107 the institution should demonstrate good knowledge of the work performed by the third party in producing the estimates. In particular, the institution should demonstrate a good understanding of the data cleansing process, assumptions used, methodological choices and resulting limitations. The institution should also monitor the performance of the rating systems involved and be able to audit them, and have clear triggers for requesting a model review."


8.3.3 Model development and maintenance
"125. When institutions delegate the development and/or maintenance of internal models, this should be done in accordance with all existing regulatory requirements and the institutions' internal guidelines and policies, also taking this guide into account. If an institution plans to delegate such tasks to a third party that would perform them outside the EU, it is encouraged to discuss this with the competent authority in advance."
"126. As the ultimate model owners and users, institutions should do the following: (a) maintain an appropriate level of in-house knowledge (see Section 8.3.5 of the this chapter); (b) have a robust contingency plan in place to ensure that they are prepared for the risk that could derive from insufficient maintenance of the rating systems."
8.3.4 Use of pool models
"127. In accordance with Article 179(2)(d) of the CRR, an institution using pool models must remain responsible for the integrity of its rating systems. In particular, the institution is ultimately responsible for the performance of the internal validation activities as elaborated in Section 4 of this chapter."
"128. To comply with the requirement to ensure integrity of the rating system specified in Article 179(2)(d) of the CRR, if deficiencies are identified in the pooled rating system at institution level, the institution should be able to independently trigger a procedure designed to amend the system, if necessary, at individual or pool level. This applies regardless of the performance of the rating system at the pool level or at the level of the other participating institutions."
"129. Where a third party is involved in the tasks of developing a rating system and risk estimation for an institution, the institution should verify that the validation activities with regard to those rating system and those risk estimates are not performed by that third party. Where, for the purpose of developing a rating system and risk estimation, the institution uses data that is pooled across institutions and a third party is developing the rating system, the third party may assist the institution in its validation activities by performing those tasks of validation which require access to the pooled data."

8.3.5 In-house knowledge
"130. To ensure that institutions are able to identify, manage and monitor the risks connected with internal models, they should maintain adequate in-house knowledge and core competence, as they are ultimately responsible for outsourced tasks and functions. Institutions should have access to all relevant information; this will enable them to take direct control of an outsourced activity in extremis. Best practice to ensure that this in-house knowledge is maintained includes ad hoc training at all levels (not only at management level) and proper oversight of the outsourced activities."
"131. In the relationship with the third party, and for the purpose of maintaining appropriate in-house knowledge and responsibilities, the ECB would consider the following practices as being advisable in the event of third-party involvement in IRB-related tasks: (a) the terms of the contract include transparency requirements; (b) the institution has full access to all relevant information regarding internal model-related topics; (c) the institution receives regular reports; (d) on request, the institution is provided with specific reports; (e) on request, the third party provides support and attends interviews with the competent authorities."
"132. In cases where third parties are involved in model (re-)development and/or parameter (re-)calibration, to ensure that the institution maintains sufficient inhouse knowledge and an adequate understanding of the rating system or that part of the rating system obtained from the third party 109, the ECB would consider the following practices as being advisable with regard to both the methodology and the data used for (re-)development and (re-)calibration: (a) The institution has access to all relevant information that enables it to understand the main model assumptions and risk estimation processes. (b) The institution has access to its own obligors' information. (c) In cases where pooled or external data are used for model development or calibration, the institution is able to assess to what degree the portfolio on which the model is based/developed is representative of its own portfolio, for the purposes of risk differentiation and risk quantification. (d) The institution has sufficient knowledge of the definition of default applied for the purposes of risk differentiation and risk quantification. (e) The institution has access to all necessary information to enable it to perform independent validation, including the validation of the model assumptions and performance of its own portfolio. (f) The institution has a specific change policy in place for models developed by third parties. (g) The institution is able to assess the need for a model change. The criteria that trigger a model change should be reflected in both the institution's model change policy and the contract with the third party, to ensure that the institution is able to make or request changes to the models."
8.3.6 Independent monitoring of third-party performance

"133. To ensure that it is able to identify and manage the risks connected with internal model-related outsourced tasks, the institution should also independently monitor the performance of third parties and have appropriate processes in place in this regard. This practice reinforces the fact that the institutions are the ultimate users of the rating systems and thus have the ultimate responsibility for their operations."
"134. The following are considered by the ECB as good practices with regard to monitoring third-party provisioning of external data. (a) Similar data vetting should be performed as would be the case if the data or service were provided in-house. Data quality checks should be automated (IT/batch processes) when possible, and technical issues as well as reasonableness and consistency should be considered. (b) Historical differences in the data provided should trigger inquiries if justified, or if there has been an error. (c) Where external data are used, their representativeness, appropriateness and consistency with regard to the institution should be assessed. (d) Cross-checks should be carried out between different databases (when available) or between different providers. This is a sign of consistency and robustness. (e) SLAs/contract agreements should include the required specific key performance indicators (KPIs) and performance metrics. (f) It should be recognised that the data quality of the information provided cannot be determined by its predictive power or by the performance of the model itself."

"135. The following are considered by the ECB as good practices with regard to monitoring third-party IRB-related tasks: (a) the same standards of monitoring and audit should be applied to external tasks as to those performed in-house; (b) SLAs/contract agreements should include the specific KPIs and performance metrics that the service should include; (c) specific bodies should be designated, with clear responsibilities regarding the monitoring of external IRB activities (such as a monitoring committee)."

Credit risk
1 Scope of the credit risk chapter
"1. The purpose of this chapter is to provide transparency on how the ECB understands a number of topics related to internal models used for the IRB approach, including an initial section covering data maintenance for this approach. It is important to note that this chapter does not aim to cover exhaustively all topics of the CRR for the IRB approach that could be subject to review during internal model investigations. On these selected topics, the chapter is aligned with the EBA GL on PD and LGD."
2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach
2.1 Relevant regulatory references
"2. In accordance with Article 144(1) of the CRR, an institution's systems for the management and rating of credit risk exposures must be sound and implemented with integrity. In particular, the institution must collect and store all relevant data to provide effective support to its credit risk measurement and management processes. The ECB understands that, in order to comply with these requirements, institutions should deploy robust, well-documented and adequately tested IT systems, together with sound data management practices."
"3. Consequently, this section of the guide sets out the principles regarding the following elements for the management of IRB data: 4 (a) IT systems: infrastructure and implementation testing; (b) policies, roles and responsibilities in data processing and data quality management; (c) components of the data quality management framework."
2.2 IT systems: infrastructure and implementation testing
2.2.1 Infrastructure
"4. Sound and robust IT infrastructures play an essential role in supporting the institution's rating systems. In addition, and in accordance with Article 175(1) of the CRR, institutions must document the design and operational details of their rating systems."
"5. With regard to the soundness and robustness of institutions' IT infrastructure, the ECB considers that Article 78(2) and (3) of the Final Draft RTS on assessment methodology for IRB provides a good understanding of the elements that institutions should take into account in order to comply with the data-related requirements of the CRR. 5"
"6. Furthermore, to comply with the documentation requirements for the rating systems as established under Article 144(1)(e) and Article 175(1) of the CRR, it is the ECB's view that institutions should document and keep an updated register of all current and past versions of the following elements of a rating system: (a) the model's data 6 flow (from data entry 7 to reporting and for both historical data and current exposure data), identifying the relevant workflows and procedures relating to data extraction, data collection, data storage and data transformations; (b) the relevant sources of data and the global map of IT systems and databases involved in the calculation systems used for the purposes of the IRB approach; (c) the relevant functional specification of IT systems and databases, including their size, date of construction and data dictionaries, specifying the content of the fields and of the different valid data values that could be inserted in them, with clear definitions of data items; (d) the relevant technical specification of IT systems and databases, including the type of database, tables, database management system, database architecture, and data models given in any standard data modelling notation; (e) the audit trail for critical IT systems and databases. To allow an independent knowledgeable third party to obtain a detailed outline of the different IT elements of the rating systems, the documentation produced by the institution should be clear and understandable. To comply with the requirement to document its rating system and the rationale for its design, 8 the institution should keep the register of all rating systems, including all current and past versions of rating systems, updated for a period of at least three years and, whenever necessary, an extended period beyond that. This is also reflected in Article 33(1) of the Final Draft RTS on assessment methodology for IRB. In any case, the institution should ensure that the elements mentioned in paragraph 6(a) to (e) for the current rating system are adequately recorded in the register and enable a clear understanding of all relevant data of the current rating system that must be stored by the institution. 9"

2.2.2 Implementation testing
"7. In order to ensure the integrity and robustness of IT systems 10 and in particular that, in terms of IT, the implementation of the models is successful and errorfree, institutions should have in place a consistent process for testing the relevant IRB systems and applications upon first implementation and on an ongoing basis. This IT-testing process should be clearly defined and documented in an organisation-wide policy and procedure."
"8. To achieve its objective the policy should consider all potential events that should trigger a testing procedure and their impact on the tests to be conducted. The trigger events that should be considered include: software releases or material IT-related changes, regulatory changes, model methodology changes and the extension of the range of application of a rating system."
"9. IT implementation tests to be considered include the following: (a) unit/component/module tests; (b) integration tests (of units and between systems); (c) system tests (this includes functionality, performance ?€? in normal and stress scenarios ?€? and security and portability tests); (d) user acceptance testing (functional testing); (e) regression testing."
"10. In principle, the unit(s) responsible for performing the implementation tests should be clearly identified and the results of the tests should be documented. It is the ECB's view that as a general rule institutions should develop a standardised format for the documentation of test results."

"2.3 Policies, roles and responsibilities in data processing and data quality management"
"11. For institutions to be able to comply with the requirement to collect and store all relevant data established under Article 144(1)(d) of the CRR, it is the ECB's understanding that policies and rules on data management should be defined at group level 11 for both of the following aspects: data processing (i.e. data collection, storage, validation, migration, actualisation and use), and data quality management (see Section 2.4 of this chapter)."
"12. As for data processing, and in particular with regard to manual interventions and data transfers, the following principles should be considered: (a) to ensure that all data transformations are traceable and controlled, general guidelines and rules should be clearly formalised with regard to manual interventions within the data processing; (b) to ensure timeliness and accountability, all data transfers should be formally agreed upon (for example by means of service level agreements) by data providers and data users (for both outsourced and in-house processes)."
"13. To ensure the integrity of the data processes, the policies and rules on data management should clearly set out the relevant data governance arrangements. It is also expected that these policies and rules will specify the different roles and responsibilities assigned to data management. These include data quality roles and responsibilities for both business owners and IT functions and data and systems ownership throughout the entire credit risk modelling life cycle (including all IT systems used). These policies should take into account the following principles. (a) The responsibilities of business owners include: (i) ensuring data are correctly entered, kept up-to-date and aligned with the institution¡¯s data definitions; (ii) ensuring that data aggregation capabilities and reporting practices are consistent with the institution¡¯s policies (b) IT functions are responsible for supporting the operation of the systems for data collection, processing, transforma"


2.4 Data quality management framework
"14. Institutions must have in place a process for vetting data inputs into the model. This must include an assessment of the accuracy, completeness and appropriateness of the data. 12 To comply with this requirement and to ensure the quality of the data used for credit risk measurement and management processes, it is the ECB's view that institutions should establish and implement an effective data quality management framework that is formalised in a set of policies and procedures. This framework should be applicable to all data used in IRB-related processes, i.e. internal data, external data and pooled data, if any. In addition, it should ensure that reliable risk information is available to enable an institution's risk profile to be assessed accurately and drive sound decision-making within the institution and by external stakeholders, including competent authorities."
"15. The ECB considers that the data quality management framework is effective when it encompasses the following components: 12 (a) sound underlying governance principles (see Section 2.4.1 of this chapter), particularly those relating to the allocation and fulfilment of roles and responsibilities for the management of data quality in a manner that ensures that data quality management activities are independent of data processing activities; (b) a description of the scope in terms of risk data coverage (see Section 2.4.2); (c) data quality standards covering all relevant data quality dimensions, i.e. completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness, uniqueness, validity, availability and traceability (see Section 2.4.3); (d) consistent criteria and a systematic metrics approach to assess compliance with data quality standards; this should be supported by sufficient data quality controls along the entire IRB data chain (see Section 2.4.4); (e) procedures for constantly assessing and improving the quality of data (see Section 2.4.5); (f) reporting procedures on data quality allowing for sufficient understanding of the quality of the data supporting the IRB models (see Section 2.4.6). The following sections further develop the above-mentioned elements."

2.4.1 Governance principles for the data quality management framework
"16. The data quality management framework: (a) should be approved by the institution's management body or a designated committee thereof and senior management as part of their responsibilities; (b) should be distributed throughout the organisation to the relevant staff; (c) should be regularly assessed in order to verify its adequacy, and be updated and improved whenever necessary; (d) should be subject to regular review by the internal audit function or another comparable independent auditing unit. 13"
"17. The roles of the different units, internal bodies and staff involved in the data quality management process should be defined in such a way as to ensure that the data handling process is sufficiently independent of the data quality management process."
"18. The ECB considers it good practice for institutions to have a dedicated independent unit with an overall view of and responsibility for the management of data quality. Where an independent unit is established, the size of this unit should be proportionate to the nature, size and degree of complexity of the institution's business and organisational structure."
2.4.2 Scope of the data quality management framework
"19. The data quality management framework: (a) should cover all relevant data quality dimensions: completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness, uniqueness, validity, availability and traceability (see paragraph 21); (b) should cover the whole data life cycle, from data entry to reporting, and encompass both historical data and current application databases."
"20. If institutions use data provided by third parties, the ECB considers it good practice for them to ensure that the third party has data quality processes in place to ensure the accuracy, completeness and appropriateness of the data provided. 14"
2.4.3 Data quality standards in the data quality management framework
"21. In accordance with Article 174(b) of the CRR, institutions must implement a process for vetting data inputs into the model which must include an assessment of the accuracy, completeness and appropriateness of data. The ECB understands that, in order to comply with this requirement, institutions should establish data quality standards that set the objectives and overall scope of the data quality management process. To this end, these standards should be defined for the following data quality dimensions 15 for all data inputs into the model and at each stage of the data life cycle: (a) completeness (values are present in any attributes that require them); (b) accuracy (data are substantively error-free); (c) consistency (a given set of data can be matched across the institution's different data sources); (d) timeliness (data values are up-to-date); (e) uniqueness (aggregate data are free from any duplication arising from filters or other transformations of source data); (f) validity (data are founded on an adequate and rigorous classification system that ensures their acceptance); (g) availability/accessibility (data are made available to the relevant stakeholders); (h) traceability (the history, processing and location of the data under consideration can be easily traced)."
2.4.4 Data quality controls
22. Data quality should be measured in an integrated and systematic way. The measurement system and the frequency of its application should be formalised.
23. Indicators and their corresponding tolerance levels and thresholds should be set in order to monitor compliance with the standards established and should be combined with visual systems (e.g. red/amber/green traffic-light system) and dashboards for monitoring and reporting purposes.
"24. Indicators should be supported by effective and sufficient data quality checks and controls throughout the data life cycle, from data entry to reporting, and for both historical data and current application data. Data quality checks and controls should include reconciliation across and within systems, including between accounting and IRB data. An effective control framework should therefore be in place to ensure that sound controls and related procedures are implemented, especially for manual processes."

2.4.5 Remediation of data quality issues
25. A process for the identification and remediation of data quality deficiencies should be in place in order to constantly improve data quality and promote compliance with the data quality standards.
"26. Data quality assessments should be carried out independently (see paragraphs 17 and 18) and recommendations should be issued with an indication of their priority, based on the materiality of the incidents identified. All such data quality incidents should be recorded and monitored. For each of the data quality incidents, an owner responsible for resolving the incident should be appointed and an action plan for dealing with the incident drawn up on the basis of the priority assigned. Remediation timelines should depend on the severity and impact of the incident and the implementation timelines required to resolve it. Data quality incidents should be resolved at source level 16 or, if this is not possible, mitigated by taking a prudent approach."
2.4.6 Data quality reporting
"27. In accordance with Article 189(2)(c) of the CRR, the institution's senior management must ensure, on an ongoing basis, that the ratings systems are working properly. To accomplish this, the ECB understands that a formal reporting process on the quality of risk data should be in place with the objective of improving the quality of data and enabling an assessment of the potential impact of data quality in own fund requirements calculations. In general, this reporting should be presented in a standardised format with clear and concise content, including the following: 16 (a) comprehensive overview of the performance of the model in terms of data quality, including external data and pooled data, if any, at all stages of the IRB life cycle, from data entry to reporting, for both historical data and current exposure data; (b) findings and, where applicable, recommendations to address detected weaknesses or shortfalls; (c) sufficient and appropriate evidence that the recommendations have been adequately addressed and properly implemented (e.g. by means of a status report). From the source system in which the incidents are present down to the IRB datasets or systems."
"28. In accordance with Article 189(1) of the CRR, the management body or a designated committee thereof and senior management must possess a general understanding of the rating systems of the institution and a detailed comprehension of its associated management reports. To comply with this requirement, the ECB understands that reports on the quality of risk data should be submitted to these parties. In addition, the ECB considers it good practice for these reports to also be submitted to all other relevant staff, including modellers, internal validation, internal audit, data quality managers, data owners and other business units involved."
"29. Data quality reports should be produced and submitted to senior management more frequently than annually to enable senior management to ensure, on an ongoing basis, that the rating systems are operating properly in accordance with Article 189(2)(c) of the CRR."
3 Use of data
3.1 Relevant regulatory references
"30. In accordance with Article 144(1)(d) of the CRR, institutions must collect and store all relevant data to provide effective support to their credit risk measurement and management processes. Furthermore, good data quality is a fundamental condition for developing a robust rating system. The ECB considers that, to comply with these requirements and ensure the quality of data, institutions should have sound policies, processes and methods in place, under paragraphs 15 to 34 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD for assessing and improving the quality and representativeness of the data used in the modelling and risk quantification process."
"31. Since the data-related requirements of the CRR also apply in cases where an institution estimates CCFs, paragraph 30 is also relevant for such institutions."
3.2 Use of external data
"32. Data-related requirements established under the CRR apply to all data: internal, external or pooled. In the ECB's understanding, therefore, paragraph 30 is also relevant in the event that an institution uses external or pooled data. The principles on the collection and storage of data are relevant to the institutions' own data and to the data received from the pool."
"33. To ensure that credit risk management and measurement processes are built on appropriate data, for the purposes of risk differentiation, risk quantification and review of estimates institutions should assess whether external data can be used to complement internal data when they consider they do not have sufficient available internal data."
"34. In addition, when institutions use different data sources (including different external databases, whether or not combined with internal data) for the purpose of risk quantification, there could be a risk that the sources include common obligors among the data sources used for risk quantification. This could lead to bias or double-counting effects in the calculation of one-year default rates. To avoid this risk, institutions should develop the necessary processes in order to identify common obligors within these databases and ensure that each common obligor is only taken into account once in the calculation of one-year default rates. 17 When institutions are not able to identify common obligors, they should analyse potential bias or double-counting effects in the calculation of one-year default rates. These bias or double-counting effects should be reflected appropriately in the computation of one-year default rates and long-run average (LRA) default rates."
"35. If an institution uses statistical models and other mechanical methods to assign exposures to obligors or facilities grades or pools, the data used to build the model must be representative of the population of the institution's actual obligors or facilities. 18 If external data are used, the same requirements with regard to representativeness 19 must be applicable vis-a-vis the bank's portfolio or portfolio subset for which the external data are used."
"36. Proving representativeness in cases where an institution uses external data is generally more difficult, as internal data are scarce. If an institution cannot provide sufficient proof that the external data are representative, in the ECB's view it may still use external data if it shows (by quantitative analysis and/or qualitative argumentation) that the information gained from the use of the external data outweighs any drawbacks stemming from the deficiencies identified and an appropriate margin of conservatism (MoC) is applied. In particular, institutions should provide evidence that the model's performance does not deteriorate when including information derived from the external data, and that the parameter estimates are not biased. To assess these issues, the institution should conduct quantitative and qualitative analyses specifically designed for this purpose."

"37. In accordance with Article 174(b) of the CRR, if an institution uses statistical models and other mechanical methods to assign exposures to obligors or facilities grades or pools, it must have in place a process for vetting data inputs to the model, which should include an assessment of the accuracy, completeness and appropriateness of the data. In addition, and in accordance with Article 179(1)(a), in quantifying the risk parameters to be associated with rating grades or pools institutions must incorporate all relevant data, information and methods. To comply with these requirements, institutions should ensure that, when external data are used for risk differentiation, risk quantification or review of estimates, they know the data sources and the most relevant data processing operations of the variables acting as direct model inputs performed by the data provider. Institutions should be able to differentiate between internal and external data and to document which information is internal and which information is received from external data sources. To ensure that the data remain appropriate, institutions should provide an adequate rationale in the event that, for the purpose of risk differentiation, risk quantification or review of estimates, they modify the external data acquired, select only part of a wider external database or use different external providers."
3.3 Use of external bureau scores or external ratings as input variables in the rating process
"38. Where an institution uses external credit bureau scores or external ratings as input variables in the rating process, and in particular when externally sourced scores are the main (or one of the main) input variable(s) of the overall internal rating, there is a risk that an internal model may not consider all relevant information. In the ECB's understanding, institutions mitigate this risk when they comply with the following principles. (a) The external scores or ratings and/or data are regularly updated or refreshed, especially where credit bureau information is dynamic and is used not only for the application rating but also for the ongoing behavioural rating. (b) Institutions understand the structure and nature of external scores or ratings and their key drivers. They also regularly verify that the results of the credit bureau score continue to be appropriate input variables in their credit rating process, for example by reviewing any changes in the credit bureau score methodology. The greater the importance of the external scores or ratings, the greater understanding institutions should demonstrate of their structure, nature and key drivers and the higher the frequency that should be considered in monitoring the appropriateness of these external scores or ratings. (c) Validation requirements are similar to those applied to other internal and external input variables. (d) Even when the external score or rating is the main (or one of the main) driver(s) of the internal rating, the institution ensures that all relevant internal information regarding the creditworthiness of the obligor is taken into account with sufficient weighting in the internal rating. In addition, the institution demonstrates that the additional relevant internal information considered in the model and its weighting are sufficient to ensure that the internal rating does not merely take on the results of the external bureau scores or the external ratings used. (e) When institutions make use of external scores or ratings or any other judgement-based assessment provided by a third party as input variables in the rating process, they should ensure that any potential correlation between the relevant risk drivers does not lead to bias or a doublecounting effect in the risk parameter estimates. This can be especially relevant in these cases, due to the potential use of duplicated information. (f) The institution remains responsible for the performance of the model."

3.4 Use of pooled data 20
"39. The use of pooled data is treated similarly to the situation where internal data are combined with data derived from a different (and external) set of obligors or facilities, as mentioned in Section 3.2."
"40. In accordance with Article 179(2)(a) of the CRR, where an institution uses data that are pooled across institutions the rating systems and criteria of other institutions in the pool must be similar to its own. To comply with this requirement an institution should, among other things: (a) ensure that there is a common definition of the key drivers and processes; (b) ensure that policies and procedures considered for human judgement, including overrides 21, can be applied in a comparable and similar manner across all participating institutions."
3.5 Use of purchased rating systems or models (pool models 22 23)
"41. In accordance with the last sentence of Article 144(1) of the CRR, the requirements to use an IRB approach, including own estimates and CCFs, apply also where an institution has implemented a rating system, or model used within a rating system, that it has purchased from a third-party vendor. To comply with this provision, institutions should ensure in such cases that all relevant internal information for model development and parameter calibration is taken into account. In particular, LRAs of default rates, LGD and CCFs based only on internal data should always be computed and considered for calibration. The institution remains responsible for the performance of the rating system or model."
"42. In addition, to ensure the integrity of the rating systems or internal models when institutions make use of pool models, and to comply with Article 144(1) of the CRR, the principles set out below should be followed. (a) If PD estimates are calculated using pooled data, institutions should verify that the data used for risk quantification meet the data requirements for default rate calculation as clarified in paragraph 80 below, or that the data are adjusted accordingly. (b) Where several institutions use a common pool model, each should ensure that its rating process is aligned to the extent that all input risk drivers are defined in the same way across all participating institutions. The institutions should also ensure that all assessments of the qualitative components of the rating model are performed in a comparable manner. (c) If a pool model is used for the estimation of risk parameters and the model-relevant parts of the process for managing distressed obligors (including the strategy before and after default) of the participating institutions are not aligned, these differences should be appropriately taken into account within the model or through an appropriate adjustment, in accordance with paragraph 37(a)(viii) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. In the case of a pool model for the estimation of LGD parameters, differences in the model-relevant parts of the workout processes should also be taken into account within the model or through an appropriate adjustment. (d) Institutions should ensure that all relevant internal information with respect to the creditworthiness of an obligor is taken into account and the rating is updated with new information in a timely manner. (e) Each institution should remain responsible for the performance of the rating model on its own portfolio."

"43. To ensure that its ratings systems are operating properly on an ongoing basis, if an institution introduces systematic adjustments to the outputs of the pool model, the institution concerned should initiate internal procedures to analyse whether significant weaknesses in the model exist and whether a model change needs to be triggered."
3.6 Consistency in the definition of default
"44. In accordance with Article 178(4) of the CRR, institutions that use external data that are not in themselves consistent with the definition of default laid down in paragraph 1 of that Article must make appropriate adjustments to achieve broad equivalence with the definition of default. To comply with this requirement, institutions should ensure that when they make use of external data or pooled data they have a complete understanding of the definition of default applied to these data and perform a comparison between the definition of default used and the requirements of Article 178 of the CRR. If there are differences between the definition of default applied in the external or pooled data and the institution's own definition of default, the institution should assess the differences and describe the adjustments made to the risk estimates, in order to achieve the required level of consistency with the internal definition of default. It should also include an appropriate MoC to account for the adjustments included. These adjustments should be appropriately documented and justified, in particular by providing reasonable assurance that they do not undermine the validity of the approach for the purposes of risk differentiation and risk quantification."
3.7 Use of human judgement
"45. In accordance with Article 171(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions must have specific definitions, processes and criteria for assigning exposures to grades or pools. The grade and pool definitions must be sufficiently detailed. To comply with this provision, institutions should ensure that, when human judgement is used in the assignment of exposures to grades or pools, there is a framework in place that establishes clear and detailed guidelines and procedures on the application of human judgement (e.g. through the use of pre-defined questionnaires). The use of human judgement should be documented in a way that ensures the rating assignment can be understood and replicated by a third party. 24 To ensure the replicability and consistency of the rating assignment process, the principles set out below should be followed. (a) The basic structure of the model 25 should be applied consistently and not modified by human judgement. It should, in particular, consist of: (i) the minimum data sources to be used for the grade/pool assignment; (ii) the complete list of pre-defined risk drivers which need to be assessed individually and for which the assessments need to be stored; (iii) the importance of and the evaluation criteria for the risk drivers, particularly the functional relationship 26 between risk drivers and the assigned rating (before overrides); (iv) the procedures and steps to be followed during the assessment, including the steps where overrides can be applied. (b) Institutions should assess the consistency of the rating assignment process. To this end, they should define the tests and analyses in a way that is proportionate to the degree of human judgement applied. In cases where human judgement is the main component of the rating assignment process, these tests should at least include an analysis of consistency in a representative sample by having obligors re-rated independently by different analysts. The results of the ratings consistency assessment should be analysed against pre-defined thresholds as part of the framework for review of estimates."

"46. In accordance with Article 172(3) of the CRR, for grade and pool assignments institutions must document the situations in which human judgement may override the inputs or outputs of the assignment process and the personnel responsible for approving these overrides. In the context of this requirement, the ECB understands that an override is a judgement-based and discretionary action that contributes to the assessment of the obligor's creditworthiness as obtained through pre-defined components of the rating system. These comprise both automatic/quantitative components 27 and qualitative variables 28. An override constitutes a direct intervention to an input or to an intermediate 29 or final output of the rating assignment process, through an adjustment or replacement of that input or intermediate/final output which is obtained under the regular assignment process. Overrides should be limited to information relevant to the obligor's creditworthiness, if this is not captured well by the predefined components of the model."
"47. Within a rating assignment process, the use of pre-defined risk drivers in the form of qualitative model inputs should be distinguished from overrides. These judgement-based or qualitative variables are expected to be considered under the regular assignment process and as part of the pre-defined components of the rating system. Therefore, they are not themselves considered as overrides. 30"
"48. Whenever the functional relationship between the risk drivers and the assigned rating as specified in paragraph 45(a)(iii) is circumvented, for example in cases where the last-assigned rating deviates from the rating that would be assigned on the basis of this functional relationship, it is considered to be an override. For the purposes of Article 172(3) of the CRR, it should therefore be specified in the policies and criteria for the use of overrides in the rating assignment process."
"49. In accordance with Article 174(e) of the CRR, the results of the statistical model must be complemented by human judgement, especially by taking into account all information not included in the model. The higher the number of relevant observations, the more the institution should rely on the outcomes of the statistical model."
"50. In addition, when human judgement is used for the purpose of model development, for example in setting the model's assumptions, the identification of risk drivers and determination of their weights, or the identification and combination of model components, there is a risk of the model-based assignments being inaccurate. 31 To mitigate this risk, institutions should ensure that the incorporation of human judgement is appropriately managed and proportionate to the number of relevant available observations."
"51. For the purposes of quantifying the risk parameters to be associated with grades or pools, estimates must not be based purely on judgemental considerations. 32 To this end, where human judgement is used to a greater extent because of the low number of relevant available observations, institutions should apply a higher MoC to their estimates to account for additional uncertainty."
"52. In addition, whenever human judgement is used in the estimation of risk parameters (for either risk differentiation or risk quantification purposes) institutions are expected to have in place a framework under paragraph 35 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD."
4 Probability of default
4.1 Structure of PD models
4.1.1 Relevant regulatory references
"53. In accordance with Article 179(1)(a) of the CRR, estimates must be based on the material drivers of the risk parameters. The relevant material risk drivers and rating criteria may be taken into consideration in several ways: (a) when assigning exposures to different PD models; (b) at a PD model level when assigning exposures to different ranking/scoring methods; (c) as explanatory variables in ranking/scoring methods; (d) as drivers in the process for the assignment of PDs to grades or pools (e.g. calibration segments)."
"54. When choosing the risk drivers for the models, there is a risk that risk drivers that capture the characteristics of defaulted obligors could be inappropriately inferred as relevant risk drivers for the portfolio. To mitigate this risk, institutions should take appropriate measures against model misspecification with regard to overfitting. This is particularly relevant where default data for the development of the model are scarce."

"55. In accordance with Article 144(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions' rating systems must provide for a meaningful assessment of obligor and transaction characteristics, a meaningful differentiation of risk and accurate and consistent quantitative estimates of risk. To comply with this requirement, it is the ECB's understanding that PD models should perform adequately on economically significant and material sub-ranges of application. 33 The sub-ranges are identified by splitting the full range of application of the PD model into different parts on the basis of potential drivers for risk differentiation, including the following non-exhaustive list of drivers, 34 where relevant: (a) for PD models covering exposures to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs): country, industry (e.g. statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community (abbreviated as NACE 35) code section classification A to U), size of obligor (e.g. different buckets in terms of total assets), past delinquency (e.g. obligors with delinquency events, i.e. days past due, in the last 12 months); (b) for PD models covering retail exposures: client type (e.g. high net worth/private banking, other individuals, self-employed, SMEs), product type (e.g. consumer credit, credit card, other), region (e.g. nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) 1, 2 or 3 as defined by Eurostat), past delinquency (e.g. obligors with delinquency events, i.e. days past due, in the last 12 months), maturity (e.g. original or remaining maturity); (c) for PD models covering retail exposures secured by real estate: region (e.g. NUTS 1, 2 or 3 as defined by Eurostat), type of real estate (e.g. residential, commercial, other), past delinquency (e.g. obligors with delinquency events, i.e. days past due, in the last 12 months), maturity (e.g. original or remaining maturity); (d) for PD models covering exposures to financial institutions: business model (deposit-taking institutions, investment banking, insurance firms, other), jurisdiction (or global region as appropriate) and size (defined buckets of total assets); (e) for PD models covering exposures to large corporates: industry (e.g. NACE code section classification A to U), country (or global region as appropriate) and size (defined buckets of total turnover)."
"56. In accordance with Article 169(1) of the CRR, where an institution uses multiple rating systems, the rationale for assigning an obligor or a transaction to a rating system must be documented and applied in a manner that appropriately reflects the level of risk. To comply with this requirement institutions should, in terms of the range of application of a PD model: (a) clearly describe its range of application (and sub-divisions into different ranking/scoring methods and calibration segments) and also include an explanation of the risk drivers which the institution considered when designing the process but has decided not to use for the assignment of the obligor to the rating system; (b) ensure that there are no overlaps in the range of application of different PD models and that each obligor or facility to which the IRB approach should be applied can be clearly assigned to one particular PD model."
4.1.2 Risk differentiation
Principles for all model types
"57. Article 170 of the CRR lays down requirements related to the structure of rating systems. To comply with these requirements and with reference to Articles 36 to 38 of the Final Draft RTS on assessment methodology for IRB, institutions should, among other things, ensure a meaningful differentiation of risk over time which takes into account (i) the distribution of obligors or facilities; (ii) the homogeneity of obligors or facilities assigned to the same grade or pool; and (iii) the different levels of risk across obligors or facilities assigned to different grades or pools to which a different PD is applied."
"58. To ensure that the PD model performs adequately in terms of risk differentiation, institutions should adopt the following approach. (a) Define metrics (considering both their evolution over time and specific reference dates) with well-specified targets, taking into account tolerance levels that reflect the uncertainty of the metrics, and take action, where necessary, to rectify any deviations from these targets that exceed the tolerance levels. Separate targets and tolerances may be defined for initial development and ongoing performance. (b) Ensure that the tools used to assess risk differentiation are sound and adequate considering the available data. The risk differentiation is expected to be demonstrated on time series of realised default rates for grades or pools under different economic conditions."
Principles specific for grades and pools
"59. A grade or pool is understood by the ECB as the subset of obligors or facilities to which the same PD is applied for the calculation of regulatory capital requirements, irrespective of how this PD has been assigned (e.g. through the use of masterscales)."
Distribution of obligors or facilities across grades or pools
"60. Articles 170(1)(c) and (d) and 170(3)(b) and (c) of the CRR require, among other things, that the number of grades and pools is adequate to achieve meaningful risk differentiation and quantification of the PD at the grade or pool level. To comply with this requirement, institutions should: (a) justify the criteria applied when determining the number of grades or pools and the proportion of obligors or facilities assigned to each; (b) ensure that the concentration of numbers of obligors or facilities is not excessive in any grade or pool; any significant concentrations should be supported by convincing empirical evidence of the homogeneity of risk for those obligors or facilities; (c) ensure that no grade or pool has too few obligors or facilities, unless this is supported by convincing empirical evidence of the adequacy of the grouping of the exposures in question."
Homogeneity within grades
"61. Articles 170(1)(b) and (d) and 170(3)(b) and (c) of the CRR require, among other things, that the structure of rating systems must ensure the homogeneity of obligors or facilities assigned to the same grade or pool. In accordance with this requirement and under paragraph 69 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD: (a) homogeneity is understood as obligors or facilities assigned to a grade having a reasonably similar default risk to ensure that the grade-level default rate is representative of all obligors or facilities in that grade; (b) in cases where it is found (through the use of additional drivers or a different discretisation of the existing ones) that a material subset of obligors or facilities within a grade/pool yields a significantly different default rate to that of the rest of the grade or pool, this is considered to indicate a lack of homogeneity."
Risk differentiation across grades or pools
"62. To comply with the requirement to ensure adequate risk differentiation across grades or pools, 36 institutions should ensure that there are no significant overlaps in the distribution of the default risk between grades or pools. This should be ensured through a meaningful differentiation of the default rates of each grade."
Principles specific for direct estimates
63. See paragraph 90.
4.1.3 Grade assignment dynamics
"64. In order to ensure a meaningful assessment of obligor characteristics, 37 when assigning obligors or facilities to a grade or pool institutions should follow paragraphs 66 to 68 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. Although the time horizon used in PD estimation is one year, it is the ECB's understanding that the rating/grade/pool assignment process should also adequately anticipate and reflect risk over a longer time horizon and take into account plausible changes in economic conditions. In order to achieve this objective: (a) all relevant information should be included in the rating/grade/pool assignment process, giving an appropriate balance between drivers that are predictive only over a short time horizon and drivers that are predictive over a longer time horizon; (b) a horizon of two to three years is considered to be appropriate for most portfolios; (c) in accounting for plausible changes in economic conditions, the institution should consider at least past observed default patterns; (d) the model should perform under different economic conditions. As a consequence of the above, institutions' grade assignment dynamics should also adequately anticipate and reflect in the assignment of grades the risk over the longer time horizon. For clarity, this does not mean that grades remain stable over the longer time horizon in the event of changes in the risks that are specific to the obligor."
"65. Additionally, the following principles apply under the specific situations considered in (a) to (c) below:  (a) when using external scores or ratings (e.g. from an external bureau or external rating agency) as drivers for the purpose of risk differentiation within a specific model, institutions should identify the grade assignment dynamics embedded in the external rating and understand the effect on their own grade assignment dynamics, considering the other risk drivers used; (b) when using external ratings as target variables for the purpose of risk differentiation within a specific model (see Section 4.1.5), institutions should preserve their own grade assignment dynamics by taking the appropriate measures when necessary; (c) when mapping internal grades to external grades in order to use external default rates to estimate PD, institutions should ensure that the grade assignment dynamics of the external ratings are sufficiently similar to their own internal grade assignment dynamics, or perform the necessary adjustments during risk quantification to compensate for any differences."

4.1.4 Use of ratings of third parties
"66. In accordance with Article 172(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions must assign each obligor to a grade or pool as part of the credit approval process. To comply with this requirement, institutions should have a clear policy 38 specifying the conditions under which the rating of a third party which has a contractual or organisational relationship with an obligor of the institution (third-party support) may be taken into account in the risk assessment of that obligor. This policy should meet the following criteria. (a) It should specify in which situations the rating of a parent entity could be taken into account in the risk assessment of other entities of the group. In particular, the policy should specify those situations in which obligors are assigned to a better grade than their parent entities. (b) It should include provisions on the use of ratings of third parties that provide contractual support to more than one obligor. As a general rule, the policy should include, but not be limited to, possible prioritisation, eligibility, and the impact on the rating of the supporting third party."
"67. Articles 201 to 203 of the CRR establish requirements for the eligibility of unfunded credit protection. To comply with these requirements, institutions may recognise the guarantee by applying the risk weight of the guarantor under the standardised approach to the covered part of the exposure, provided that no own estimates of LGD and CCFs are used (foundation IRB (F-IRB)). This applies when an obligor is guaranteed by a third party that is not in the range of application of a PD model and the guarantee fulfils all requirements for credit risk mitigation (CRM), consistently with paragraph 44 of the EBA Report on the CRM Framework. In such situations, under paragraph 74 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, the guaranteed obligor should be included in the calculation of the one-year default rate of the grade the obligor is assigned to, before the recognition of the guarantee."

"68. In addition, when the institution reflects substitution effects 39 arising from CRM in the ratings assigned to a material number of exposures within a rating system, there is a risk that the process of assigning exposures to grades or pools might not provide for a meaningful differentiation of risk, as a result of the inclusion of obligors with significantly different risk levels within the same rating grade. 40 To mitigate this risk, institutions should verify that obligors guaranteed by a third party do not carry a significantly different level of risk from those in the same rating grade without such a guarantee, and that no separate calibration segment as referred to in paragraph 97 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD is required."
"69. When, under paragraph 62(a) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, an institution performs a rating transfer across different rating systems that do not share the same obligor rating scale, it should ensure that the mapping between rating scales is performed in such a way that the final PD estimate (including MoC) assigned to the guaranteed exposure amount is not better than the final PD estimate (including MoC) being transferred from a third party. Article 171(2) of the CRR establishes that information used to assign obligors and facilities to grades or pools must be current. To comply with this requirement, if a material proportion of exposures or obligors within a rating system receives a rating from another IRB rating system as a result of rating transfers, institutions should ensure that the transferred ratings are automatically updated when the rating of the third party changes or when the PDs of the rating system to which the third party belongs are re-estimated."
"70. In accordance with Article 179(1)(a) of the CRR, estimates must be plausible and intuitive and must be based on the material drivers of the respective risk parameters. To comply with this requirement, institutions should have sufficient empirical evidence to justify situations where an obligor has an equal or better PD estimate than the third party providing support as a consequence of the treatments specified in paragraph 62(c) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. In addition, differences between the various forms of contractual support should be considered in the PD models, unless there is sufficient empirical evidence that these differences are not relevant risk drivers. This understanding should also be taken into account if the rating of the third party is being considered as an indication for an override under paragraph 62(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD."

"71. In addition, in the situation described in paragraph 62(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, where a rating of a third party is being taken into account as an indication for an override of the assignment of the relevant obligor to a grade or pool, institutions should not assign a rating to an obligor that is better than the rating of the third party as a consequence of an override resulting solely from the existence of this third-party support."
"72. Furthermore, when third-party support is used extensively in the scope of application of a PD model, institutions should consider its existence as a potential relevant driver for risk differentiation, in accordance with Section 4.1.2."
4.1.5 Use of shadow rating models
"73. The ECB understands a shadow rating model (SRM) to be an internal rating approach that selects and weighs the risk drivers to be used for risk differentiation purposes by identifying the main factors that explain external ratings provided by an external credit assessment institution or similar organisation, rather than internal directly observed defaults."
"74. In accordance with Article 144(1)(e) of the CRR, institutions must document the rationale for their rating systems. To comply with this requirement, institutions should justify and document the rationale for the use (and the continued use) of the SRM, instead of the internal default prediction model, and also document the alternative approaches that have been considered, in accordance with Article 41 of the Final Draft RTS on assessment methodology for IRB. In addition, and without prejudice to the risk differentiation requirements, when developing the model institutions should set explicit threshold criteria in terms of capacity to explain the target ratings and take appropriate action when those thresholds are not met."
"75. Assignment criteria and processes must be periodically reviewed to determine whether they remain appropriate for the current portfolio and external conditions. 41 To comply with this requirement, as part of the review of estimates institutions should take all reasonable steps to demonstrate how the model performs on the application population in terms of predicting defaults or, if that is not possible (when there are not enough internal default data), at least in terms of predicting the target ratings."
"76. In accordance with Article 170(1)(b) of the CRR, institutions' rating systems must have an obligor rating scale which reflects exclusively the quantification of the risk of obligor default. To this end, institutions should adjust the ratings used as targets for their SRMs if they do not solely embed default risk. They should also document such adjustments."

"77. In accordance with Article 174(1)(a) of the CRR, when an institution uses a statistical model and other mechanical methods to assign exposures to obligors or facilities, the input variables must form a reasonable and effective basis for the resulting predictions. To comply with this requirement, when the institution uses an SRM external ratings should not be used as risk drivers in addition to target variables."
"78. When assigning obligors and facilities to grades or pools institutions must take all relevant information into account. 42 To comply with this requirement, when different information sources are used institutions should ensure that they understand the impact of any differences between these sources and establish adequate procedures to ensure that these differences are adequately addressed."
"79. Furthermore, the data used to build the model must be representative of the population of the institution's actual obligors or exposures. 43 To comply with this requirement, institutions should analyse and provide evidence of the representativeness of the data used for model development consistently with paragraphs 20 to 27 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD."
4.2 PD risk quantification
4.2.1 Relevant regulatory references
"80. In accordance with Article 180(1) of the CRR, for exposures to corporates, institutions, central governments and central banks and for equity exposures, institutions must estimate PDs by obligor grade from the LRA of one-year default rates. In accordance with Article 180(2) of the CRR, for retail exposures, institutions must estimate PDs by obligor/facility grade or pool from LRAs of one-year default rates. To comply with these requirements, institutions should follow Sections 4.2.2 to 4.2.6 below."
4.2.2 Calculation of observed average default rates
"81. For the calculation of the one-year default rate and observed average default rates, institutions should follow paragraphs 73 to 81 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, also considering the following. (a) It is the understanding of the ECB that, for retail exposures and when the definition of default is applied at facility level, paragraphs 73 to 81 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD can be applied facility level. (b) Exposures for which there is no commitment (considering on-balance sheet exposures, off-balance sheet items and unadvised limits) at reference date should be excluded from the calculation of the default rate. Conversely, if there is an EAD estimate, then these exposures should be included in the calculation of the default rate."
"82. For the purpose of choosing an appropriate approach under paragraph 80 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, it is the ECB's understanding that overlapping one-year time windows should preferably be used when the analysis performed by the institution under paragraphs 80(a), 80(b) and/or 80(d) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD reveals any of the following: (a) the proportion of short-term and terminated contracts and/or the respective distribution of default rates is not stable over time; (b) the observed average default rate using overlapping one-year time windows is significantly different from the observed average default rate using non-overlapping one-year time windows; (c) there is a significant variation between the observed average default rates calculated using non-overlapping one-year time windows on different reference calculation dates within a year."
"83. Institutions should estimate PDs taking their own internal data into consideration. In cases where institutions use external or pooled data series to complement their internal data for the purpose of PD estimation, the more internal default experience an institution has, the less importance it needs to give to external data. In addition, institutions should ensure that these external or pooled data series are representative in accordance with Section 3.2 of this guide. 44 To comply with the requirement for the data to be representative and as part of their representativeness analysis, institutions should also ensure that the average observed default rates from external data or from the external part of the pooled data are calculated separately from, and compared with, those based on internal data. 45 This comparison should be made at the levels at which the default rate is to be calculated. This means, in accordance with paragraph 79 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, that the comparison should be made for each rating grade or pool and for the type of exposures covered by the relevant PD model, as well as for any relevant calibration segment. The direction and magnitude of the differences between these averages should be properly analysed and documented when calibrating the model, including the need and adequacy of the category A MoC considered with regard to paragraph 37(a)(viii) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, and duly followed up in the review of estimates."
4.2.3 Calibration to the LRA default rate
"84. To calculate the LRA default rate, institutions should follow paragraphs 82 to 86 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. If an institution makes adjustments to the observed average default rates in order to obtain LRA default rates under paragraph 85(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, these adjustments should be based on (external) default rates, or - if no appropriate default rates are available - on other observed indicators relevant for the type of exposures considered."

"85. For the purpose of assessing the representativeness of the historical observation period used for the likely range of variability of one-year default rates under paragraph 83 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, the following should be taken into account. (a) Where the scarcity of internal exposures and/or defaults might unduly influence the variability of internally observed default rates (i.e. where the variability driven by statistical uncertainty is so high in comparison with the structural variability of default rates that it hampers any analysis of them), institutions should assess whether external or pooled default rate series can be used to identify the relevant historical observation period for the likely range of variability of one-year default rates. The external or pooled default series used should be relevant for the specific portfolio at least in terms of geographical composition, sectoral distribution and other relevant risk drivers. When no relevant default rate series can be identified, the items described in paragraphs 83(b) and 83(c) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD should play a crucial role in the assessment. (b) When taking into account the existence of one-year default rates relating to bad years as reflected in economic indicators that are relevant for the considered types of exposures within the historical observation period as referred to in paragraph 83(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, institutions should ensure that such indicators are relevant for the portfolio at least in the terms of geographical composition, sectoral distribution and other risk drivers relevant to the portfolio."
"86. With respect to calibration to the LRA default rate, institutions should follow paragraphs 87 to 99 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. If an institution chooses the approach referred to in paragraph 92(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, it should perform additional tests as part of the development and ongoing monitoring of its models to ensure that the final (post-calibration) PDs reflect the LRA default rate of each grade. Specifically, institutions should ensure that there are no systematic deviations when comparing the estimated PDs with the LRA default rate of the grades, i.e. the direction of divergences across grades should be random."
4.2.4 Weighting for retail exposures
"87. Notwithstanding paragraph 84, for retail exposures institutions need not give equal importance to historical data if more recent data are a better predictor of loss rates. 46 In the understanding of the ECB an institution may consider that the more recent data are a better predictor of loss rates and may give more importance to recent historical data if the following apply. (a) There is a significant improvement in the predictive power when using the more recent data with respect to the predictive power resulting from the use of an arithmetic average under paragraph 81 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. This improvement should be evidenced by comparing the estimated PDs for each grade with the realised default rates covering as long a period as possible, in accordance with Article 185(b) of the CRR. (b) Older data are considered as non-representative as a result of specific policy or business changes in the bank, but not in order to reflect current trends in default rates directly related to macroeconomic conditions. (c) The weighting approach is used in a consistent manner over time and any change in the applied weights of historical data is appropriately justified."

4.2.5 PD quantification based on mapping to external grades
"88. The ECB interprets the possibility for institutions to attribute the default rate observed for the grades of a rating agency or similar organisation to its own grades in accordance with Article 180(1)(f) of the CRR as being equivalent to the use of external data for PD quantification at a more aggregated level (external grade) rather than at the obligor/facility level. Accordingly, Sections 3.2 and 4.2.2 of this chapter are relevant for institutions that do so."
"89. In accordance with Article 180(1)(f) of the CRR, mappings must be based on a comparison of internal rating criteria with the criteria used by the external organisation and on a comparison of the internal and external ratings of any common obligors. Biases or inconsistencies in the mapping approach or underlying data must be avoided. To comply with these requirements, institutions should follow the paragraphs listed below. 46 (a) Institutions should ensure that the quality of the mapping between internal and external rating scales at a given date and over time is consistent and provides for an adequate level of predictive ability. (b) When mapping internal grades to external grades, institutions should document and analyse any differences between the external and internal rating criteria. (c) The use of common obligors as a basis for the mapping should take into account their representativeness for the application portfolio. Article 180(2)(e) of the CRR. (d) Institutions should adjust the external rating scale if such rating scale does not solely embed default risk. 47 They should also document such adjustments. (e) When mapping internal grades to external grades and using the default rates of the external grades provided by the organisation, if the latter has a material number of entities for which it no longer provides a rating (withdrawn rating), the institution should take this into account. It should adjust the external default rates accordingly, if necessary, and take into consideration the provisions of paragraph 75 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. In the event that an adjustment is performed, the institution should add the necessary MoC."
4.2.6 Specific requirements for direct PD estimates

"90. In order to use direct PD estimates for the calculation of own funds requirements in accordance with Article 169(3) of the CRR, institutions should follow paragraphs 96 and 98(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. To assess whether the theoretical assumptions of the probability model underlying the estimation methodology are satisfied to a sufficient extent in practice under paragraph 96 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, institutions should do the following. 47 (a) Ensure good risk differentiation properties across the full PD range of the rating system. (b) Have an adequate and documented concept in place specifying the calibration function currently implemented (concrete functional form), including the underlying theoretical assumptions and the established processes to conduct the PD calibration. It is the ECB's understanding that institutions should ensure consistency between the score-inferred PDs and the observed default rates and should understand and justify the transformation of the scores into PD values. (c) Ensure that any transformation of the scores resulting from the probability model that is applied during the calibration does not change the ranking of the obligors/facilities (in other words, co-monotonicity between scores/raw PDs and PD values should be ensured). Moreover, institutions should avoid any undue influence of extreme values of score-inferred PDs on the shape of the calibration function. Additionally, and when institutions use different calibration functions for different sub-ranges, they should ensure that this mix is appropriate (both in terms of the functional forms used and the cut-offs selected) and that it is appropriately justified. In accordance with Article 170(1)(b) of the CRR, institutions' rating systems must have an obligor rating scale which reflects exclusively the quantification of the risk of obligor default. (d) Ensure that there is a relevant number of observations across the whole range of score-inferred PDs. Particular interest should be paid to situations where the probability model is extended to ranges of PD values where there are not enough defaulted observations. (e) Ensure that there are no excessive concentrations of exposures or obligors within the PD range of the rating system. In addition, high concentrations of observations in a specific range of score-inferred PDs should be properly analysed and justified in terms of homogeneity. (f) For the purpose of performing the additional tests at grade level referred to in paragraph 92(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, grades should be understood as sub-ranges of PD values. These sub-ranges should be defined in a way that: (i) represents sufficiently narrow ranges of PD values; (ii) contains a sufficient number of observations to ensure a meaningful calculation of the LRA default rate of the sub-range."

"91. In cases where institutions map the PDs to a masterscale (defined in terms of PD bounds) as a final step in the PD estimation process (using masterscale discrete PDs for the purpose of RWEA calculation), there is a risk that the mapping process could distort RWEAs. To mitigate this risk, institutions should verify that deviations between the masterscale PDs and the average of the direct PDs assigned to obligors in each grade do not show a systematic or material bias towards underestimation of PD per grade over time. This analysis should be provided for both the portfolio and for each grade."
5 Loss given default
5.1 Realised LGD
5.1.1 Relevant regulatory references
5.1.2 Reference dataset
"92. Under paragraph 102 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, institutions should estimate LGDs on the basis of their own loss or recovery experience. Institutions may supplement their own historical data on defaulted exposures with external data. The more own loss experience (i.e. the more internal defaults) an institution has, the less importance it needs to give to external data. Institutions should ensure that their own historical experience contains a minimum number of defaults in order to determine whether external data are sufficiently representative."
"93. To ensure that LGD estimations are accurate and are not underestimated as a result of different external and internal recovery processes, institutions should place greater importance on comparisons of internal recovery processes with the recovery processes underlying the external data, in cases where a high weight is assigned to external data. Where limited representativeness of external data is found, a category A MoC should be considered, in order to reflect the uncertainty of the estimation under paragraph 37(a)(viii). Its magnitude should also be quantified in relation to the weight assigned to the external data."
"94. When institutions use information derived from the market price of defaulted financial instruments to supplement their internal loss or recovery experience data, there is a risk of misspecification of their LGD estimates. To mitigate this risk, institutions should ensure the following: (a) institutions should verify whether the development sample is representative of the application portfolio at least in terms of regions and product type, even when those variables have not been identified as relevant risk drivers; (b) losses derived from market prices should be increased to reflect indirect costs, as specified in paragraph 146 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD."
5.1.3 Calculation of realised LGD
"95. Article 4(1)(55) of the CRR defines LGD as the ratio of the loss on an exposure due to the default of a counterparty to the amount outstanding at default. For the purposes of Article 181(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions are required to calculate realised LGD. To comply with this requirement, it is the ECB's understanding that institutions should calculate realised LGD under paragraphs 100 to 103 and 131 to 146 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. In addition, when performing this calculation institutions should follow the observations in the succeeding paragraphs."

"96. In accordance with Article 181(1)(h) of the CRR, institutions must have estimates of LGD in-default and ELBE on defaulted exposures. To comply with this requirement, it is the ECB's understanding that all principles regarding the calculation of realised LGD should be applied for the estimation of LGD on nondefaulted exposures and for the estimation of LGD in-default and ELBE on defaulted exposures, unless mentioned otherwise (that is, if the reference date is considered instead of the date of default)."
"97. Where, in the case of retail exposures and purchased corporate receivables, institutions derive LGD estimates from realised losses and appropriate estimates of PDs in accordance with Articles 161(2) and 181(2)(a) of the CRR and under paragraph 103 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, all the principles regarding realised LGD should apply to realised losses."
"98. Institutions must document the specific definitions of default and loss used internally and ensure that they are consistent with the definitions set out in the CRR. 49 To comply with these requirements, institutions should have in place sufficiently detailed policies and procedures to ensure that the realised LGD is calculated consistently and accurately, including the implementation of the definition of economic loss. These policies and procedures should include sufficiently detailed documentation to allow third parties to replicate the calculation of realised LGD. To ensure that the policies and procedures are implemented in an appropriate and adequate manner, the calculation process should be regularly reviewed by an independent unit."
"99. In accordance with Article 181(1)(a) of the CRR and under paragraph 100 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, institutions should calculate the realised LGD at facility level for each default. In exceptional cases, the ECB considers institutions to be compliant with the requirement to calculate realised LGD at facility level if they can prove that the recovery is not performed at individual facility level but at a more aggregated level (for example, several facilities of the same or different types secured by the same collateral). The realised LGD can therefore be calculated at a more aggregated level than individual facility level. For this exceptional deviation from the calculation of realised LGD at facility level to be acceptable, institutions should: 49 (a) provide evidence that recovery at aggregated level is legally enforceable. (b) on a regular basis (as often as review of estimates is performed or more often), provide evidence that recovery at a more aggregated level than single facility level is in practice enforced. This evidence should be based on the institution's historical practice and data and demonstrate that both the recovery process and its outcomes in terms of realised loss or recovery are the same for all the facilities considered at the aggregated level. Specifically, institutions should be able to prove that all collateral within an aggregation is called irrespective of the product triggering default (thus, for a current account as for a home loan) and that realised loss or observed recovery is the same for all types of facility within the aggregation. (c) for retail exposures where institutions use definition of default at facility level in accordance with the last sentence of Article 178(1) of the CRR, ensure that the default is triggered for all aggregated facilities. In addition, institutions following this approach should: (d) ensure that the parameters are applied in a manner that is consistent with how they have been estimated, i.e. across aggregated facilities; (e) ensure that the counting unit used for the purposes of risk quantification is at this aggregated level; (f) ensure that no bias results from the aggregation of facilities, by validating the estimates (PD, LGD, CCF) at the more aggregated level also."

"100. As mentioned in paragraph 95, for the purposes of Article 181(1)(a) of the CRR institutions are required to calculate realised LGD, which is defined by Article 4(1)(55) of the CRR as the ratio of the loss on an exposure due to the default of a counterparty to the amount outstanding at default. Furthermore, Article 5(2) of the CRR defines loss as an economic loss, including material discount effects, and material direct and indirect costs associated with collecting on the instrument. In accordance with these provisions, it is the ECB's understanding that institutions should calculate realised LGD as a ratio of the economic loss to the outstanding amount of the credit obligation at the moment of default, including any amount of principal, interest or fee (hereinafter outstanding amount at default). To calculate realised LGD, institutions should follow paragraphs 131 to 146 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. In addition, they should pay particular attention to the following points. (a) Outstanding amount at default includes any part of the exposure that has been forgiven or written off before or at the date of default (paragraph 134 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD). This amount is equal to the accounting value gross of credit risk adjustment (i.e. ""provisions"") (Article 166(1) of the CRR). This amount also includes interest and fees capitalised in the institution's income statement before the moment of default. However, interest and fees capitalised after the moment of default are not considered (paragraphs 137 to 138 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD). Where institutions include additional drawings after the moment of default to estimate CCFs, these additional drawings discounted to the moment of default are added to the outstanding amount at default in the denominator (paragraphs 139 to 142 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD). In other words, institutions should ensure that the exposure used for CCF estimation, where additional drawings after default are discounted with the same discount factor as applied for LGD, is consistent with the denominator of the LGD. (b) Economic loss is calculated under paragraph 132 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. This also applies in the specific case of facilities that return to non-defaulted status, where losses arising from payment delays are expected to be accounted for as well as the ""artificial cash flow"" envisaged by paragraph 135 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. (c) When recoveries are not directly observed but calculated on the basis of the difference between exposure values at two consecutive dates or derived, even partially, from some other treatment, all assumptions should be duly justified and clearly documented in order to adequately replicate the recovery flows that occur during the recovery process in accordance with letters a) and b) above. Institutions are expected to pay particular attention to the treatment of interest and fees capitalised after default, the treatment of additional drawings and the treatment of write-offs."

"101. The economic loss as defined in Article 5(2) of the CRR also includes material discounts. The understanding of the ECB is as follows. (a) Paragraph 134 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD refers to all losses incurred through forgiveness or write-off. (b) Where institutions open new facilities to replace previously defaulted facilities as part of restructuring or for technical reasons, the economic loss should include the decrease in the degree of financial obligation arising from changes in the contractual conditions (i.e. material forgiveness or postponement of payment of principal, interest, or fees). The amount by which the financial obligation has diminished should be calculated under paragraph 51 of the EBA Guidelines on the definition of default. However, no double-counting of debt forgiveness is intended (for example, in the case of exposures that return to non-defaulted status, a possible doublecounting through the diminished financial obligation and the artificial cash flow is not intended)."
"102. Realised LGD for individual facilities may be zero or lower when it is the actual result of the recovery process (for example, where additional recoveries offset the discounting effect and costs). Institutions should, however, pay particular attention to no-loss exposures, since they may reveal issues with the calculation of realised losses ?€? for example, costs not being adequately allocated to recovery processes, or inadequate treatment of amounts forgiven or written off."
5.1.4 Treatment of multiple defaults
"103. For the purpose of LGD estimation and in order to ensure an appropriate measurement of economic loss as defined in Article 5(2) of the CRR, institutions should consider an exposure that returns to normal status and subsequently defaults in a short period of time as being constantly defaulted from the moment the first default occurred. This treatment should be applied under paragraph 101 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. In addition, institutions should follow the observations in the following paragraphs. (a) Paragraph 101 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD envisages the definition of a period longer than nine months when this is appropriate for the specific type of exposures and reflects the economic meaning of the default experience. It is the ECB's understanding that a longer period is adequate when the proportion of subsequent defaults occurring on individual facilities over a period of more than nine months is significant, unless institutions are able to provide evidence that the second (or subsequent) default is unconnected with the original default event. This evidence may include analysis of the curing process. (b) Time considered between two defaults is conditional upon the existence and length of probation periods. Where institutions have not adopted the minimum three-month probation period, or any equivalent or longer probation period, on non-distressed restructured facilities under paragraph 71 of the EBA Guidelines on the definition of default, they should consider a 12-month period for the application of paragraph 101 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. Where they have not adopted the minimum 12-month probation period, or any equivalent or longer probation period, on distressed restructured facilities under paragraph 72 of the EBA Guidelines on the definition of default, they should consider a 21-month period for the application of paragraph 101 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. (c) In the particular case of an institution opening new facilities to replace previously defaulted facilities as part of restructuring or for technical reasons, it should be able to make or trace a connection between the restructured facility and the facility (or facilities) previously advanced and which it is restructuring."

5.2 LGD structure
5.2.1 Relevant regulatory references
"104. In order to comply with the requirements regarding the structure of LGD models as set out in Article 170(1)(e) and (f) and 170(3)(b) and (c) of the CRR, institutions should follow the observations below."
"105. LGD estimates must be based on the material drivers of risk. 50 To comply with this requirement, institutions should identify and analyse potential risk drivers under paragraphs 121 to 123 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. When selecting the risk drivers, institutions should take into consideration any changes in product mix or characteristics between the reference and default dates."
"106. Institutions' rating systems must provide for a meaningful assessment of obligor and transaction characteristics, a meaningful differentiation of risk and accurate and consistent quantitative estimates of risk. 51 It is the ECB's understanding that to comply with this requirement institutions should demonstrate that, in terms of the range of application of LGD models, the model performs adequately (in terms of discriminatory power and predictive power) on economically significant and material sub-ranges of application of the rating systems. The sub-ranges are identified by splitting the full range of application of the LGD model into different parts on the basis of potential drivers for risk differentiation, among which, where relevant, the drivers referred to in paragraph 121 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD."

"107. The number of grades and pools must be adequate for a meaningful risk differentiation and for the quantification of the LGD at the grade or pool level. 52 To comply with this requirement, institutions should ensure the following (a) an adequate distribution of facilities across grades or pools in the datasets used for development and (initial and regular) validation. For this purpose: (i) any unusually low number of facilities in a grade or pool is expected to be supported by empirical evidence of the adequacy of isolating those facilities in a specific grade or pool; (ii) any unusually high concentration of facilities in a grade or pool is expected to be supported by empirical evidence of homogeneity within these grades or pools (for example by analysing whether some potential risk drivers (e.g. exposure size) that could further differentiate between riskier and less risky facilities have not been considered). (b) sufficient homogeneity of the risk within each grade or pool by providing empirical evidence that the grade-level LGD is adequate for all facilities in that grade. For this purpose, in cases where it is found (through the use of additional drivers or a different discretisation of the existing ones) that a material subset of facilities within a grade or pool yields a significantly different average realised LGD to that of the rest of the grade or pool, this is considered to indicate a lack of homogeneity. (c) sufficient heterogeneity of the risk across grades or pools by providing empirical evidence that the average realised LGD is different across consecutive grades or pools, for subsets for which there is a meaningful order."
"108. Where an institution uses direct estimates of risk parameters, these may be seen as estimates assigned to grades on a continuous rating scale. 53 In this case, in the ECB's understanding the same requirements apply when an institution uses direct estimates of risk parameters as apply to grade-based models. To comply with these requirements, institutions are expected to ensure risk differentiation in accordance with the following principles: (a) if the LGD estimates used to calculate the RWEAs are based on default weighted LRAs of realised LGDs for grades or pools, irrespective of whether at some point direct LGD estimates may have been used to define such grades or pools, this grade or pool level is the relevant one for the application of the principles set out in paragraph 107; (b) when the situation described in point (a) above does not apply and, instead, several components are estimated separately and then combined in order to obtain the direct LGD estimates at facility level, institutions should adequately analyse and reflect in the model possible dependencies between the components (e.g. through relevant risk drivers); (c) in the case of other direct LGD estimates (i.e. where no components are defined) the principles above are expected to be applied where relevant."

"109. In addition to paragraph 108 above and when institutions split the facilities into different components (for example secured and unsecured), there is a risk that a meaningful differentiation of risk will not be achieved at facility level. To mitigate this risk, institutions should ensure that no bias is introduced in the risk differentiation when combining the different components in order to obtain the final LGD estimate at facility level. Specifically: (a) the allocation of recovery flows to these components should be adequately documented and implemented in a consistent way; (b) risk differentiation (analogous to risk quantification) should be ensured with respect to facility level."
5.3 Risk quantification
5.3.1 Relevant regulatory references
5.3.2 Observed average LGD
"110. To comply with the requirement of obtaining an LRA LGD in accordance with Article 181(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions should calculate the observed average LGD under paragraphs 147, 148, 154-157 and 160 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. When performing this calculation, institutions should follow the principles set out below."
"111. Under paragraph 147 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, default observations that are triggered close to the time of the LGD estimation process (i.e. observations with a recent default when the LGD is being estimated) are part of the historical observation period and should be included in the RDS. Since for these recent defaults only limited information is available regarding the full recovery process, the treatment of incomplete recovery processes envisaged in paragraph 158 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD is more complex and could add uncertainty to the LGD estimates. It is the ECB's understanding that to mitigate this risk institutions may establish a minimum period of time during which the default should be observed in order for it to be considered in the calculation of the observed average LGD. This minimum period should be adequately justified and institutions should ensure that all relevant information regarding defaults observed for a shorter period (e.g. a change in the characteristics of defaults) is considered in the LGD estimates. In any case this period should not be longer than 12 months."

"112. For the purposes of LGD estimation (and validation), long recovery processes are expected to be considered as closed under paragraph 156 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. The objective of defining the maximum period of the recovery process (""time-to-workout"") is to avoid situations where institutions give consideration to overly optimistic recoveries from open exposures that are already at a very advanced stage of the recovery process. To achieve this, the specification of the ""time-to-workout"" should be supported by evidence of the observed pace of recoveries and be consistent with the nature of the products concerned, the type of exposures and the operational recovery process. In addition, the institution should substantiate and clearly document the studies that support the formulation of the time-to-workout and should pay particular attention to the following. (a) The specific moment after the date of default at which nearly nil evolution of the average cumulative recovery rates is observed. For example, when the cumulative recovery curves show a pronounced increase after which they flatten out, the time spent in default after the significant increase occurs could be used directly as the time-to-workout, especially in the case of unsecured exposures. (b) The period of time after the date of default where the cumulative percentage of closed/recovered exposures flattens. (c) The number of exposures used to construct the curves referred to at letters (a) and (b) above, in order to identify situations where only a few cases contribute to the shape of the curves. (d) The expected recovery rate conditioned to vintages higher than the timeto-workout. (e) For secured exposures, the share of exposures for which recoveries from collateral have not yet been realised."
5.3.3 Treatment of incomplete recovery processes
"113. In order to obtain an LRA LGD in accordance with Article 181(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions should ensure that the relevant information from incomplete recovery processes is taken into account in a conservative manner. For this purpose, institutions should analyse their incomplete recovery processes and extract the information relevant for LGD estimation under paragraphs 153 to 159 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. In addition, institutions should:  (a) justify and document their methodology for the treatment of incomplete recovery processes, and in particular how they take into account paragraph 159 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD; (b) for the purpose of paragraph 159(a) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD in particular, base the extrapolation of future recoveries on defaults arising from vintages (i.e. group of exposures which defaulted in a given period of time) for which, during the period already observed, similar average past recoveries have been realised on similar exposures; (c) in order to ensure transparency regarding the impact from the treatment of incomplete recovery processes, assess the sensitivity of the treatment with respect to the main assumptions."
5.3.4 Recovery processes where collateral has been repossessed and not yet sold

"114. In specific cases where institutions have taken possession of but not yet sold the collateral, there is a risk that the value of repossession might not adequately reflect the value of the repossessed collateral. To mitigate this risk, institutions should estimate haircuts to the value of the collateral under paragraphs 116 to 118 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. In order to ensure transparency regarding the impact from the treatment of repossessed collateral, institutions should: (a) compare the estimated haircuts with the available observations regarding the repossession and subsequent sale of similar types of collateral; (b) assess the impact on the LRA LGD of the inclusion of the repossessed collateral by performing sensitivity analyses based on the application of different haircuts to the value of the collateral (at least, by applying a haircut of 100% to cases where collateral has been repossessed but not yet sold)."
5.3.5 Long-run average
"115. To comply with the requirement of obtaining an LRA LGD by facility grade or pool in accordance with Article 181(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions should estimate LGDs under paragraphs 100 and 149 to 164 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. When performing this estimation, institutions should follow the observations below."
"116. Under paragraph 150 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, institutions should calculate the LRA LGD as an arithmetic average of realised LGDs over a historical observation period weighted by a number of defaults. When performing this calculation, institutions should observe the following points. (a) In the event of definition of default applied at obligor level, where two facilities of the same obligor are assigned to the same facility grade or pool, institutions are expected to calculate the average realised LGD as follows: first take the exposure-weighted average realised LGD at the obligor level and then take the arithmetic average LGD weighted by the number of defaulted obligors within the LGD grade. If institutions use a different approach, they should demonstrate that there are no systematic deviations from the approach referred to above. (b) Under paragraph 160 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, the realised LGD of each observation should be floored at zero for the purpose of LGD estimation. In cases where LGD estimates for specific facility grades or pools are low or even zero (in exceptional cases), in order to ensure that these estimates are accurate and not driven by (systematic) errors or distortions institutions should ensure that their estimation process is accurate. In particular, they should ensure that there is a sufficient number of observations supporting the estimate and that these outcomes are carefully monitored and scrutinised. (c) Under paragraph 162 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, institutions should apply an appropriate treatment to extremely high values of realised LGDs much above 100%, at the level of data quality, risk drivers, assignment to grades or pools or assignment to calibration segments. To ensure that the estimates are accurate, institutions are not expected to cap realised LGD values (i.e. to replace the observed value by a pre-defined value when the observed value is above the pre-defined one)."

"117. Institutions can calibrate LGD estimates to the LRA LGD calculated at the level of the calibration segment under paragraph 161(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. When calibration segments are used for the purpose of LGD estimations, institutions are expected to base their decision on a sound rationale, in particular on quantitative evidence. It is the ECB's understanding that, to comply with Article 181(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions should also calculate the LRA LGD at a more granular level than the calibration segment (i.e. individual LGD grades or pools if estimation is discrete or ranges of LGD values if the estimation is continuous). The level should be appropriate for the application of the model. In addition, institutions should ensure that there are no systematic deviations when comparing the estimated LGDs with the LRA of realised LGDs at this more granular level, i.e. the direction of divergences should be random."
"118. Where the LGD is the result of a combination of different components (for example, secured and unsecured components), the calibration step according to paragraph 117 (ensuring that the average realised LGD and the average estimated LGD across facilities within the same calibration segment/range of LGD values are aligned) is expected to be performed after the aggregation of the components. In addition, there is a risk that systematic deviations could be introduced to the estimation when combining these different components. In this case, the direction of divergences would not be random. To mitigate this risk, institutions should do the following. (a) For defaults in the RDS which are closed or considered closed, compare the realised LGD at facility level with the estimates of LGD. Separate tests should be performed for the LGD applied to the performing portfolio and the LGD in-default. Analogous tests should be performed at component level. (b) In the case of models based on components with underlying data covering time windows with different lengths and/or periods for each of the components, ensure that no bias is introduced in the LGD estimates at facility level with respect to the LRA. The analysis referred to in point (a) should be performed, at least, for the available common time period."

"119. Notwithstanding paragraph 116, for retail exposures institutions need not give equal importance to historical data if more recent data are a better predictor of loss rates. 55 It is the ECB's understanding that an institution may consider the more recent data to be a better predictor of loss rates and may give more importance to recent historical data if its methodology is in line with paragraphs 150 to 152 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD and if the following apply. (a) There is a significant improvement in predictive power when using the more recent data with respect to the predictive power resulting from the use of an arithmetic average under paragraph 150 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. This improvement would be evidenced by comparing the estimated LGDs for each grade with the average realised LGD covering as long a period as possible in accordance with Article 185(b) of the CRR. (b) The oldest data are considered as non-representative as a result of specific policy or business changes in the bank, but not in order to reflect current trends in loss rates directly related to macroeconomic conditions. (c) The weighting approach is used in a consistent manner over time and any change in the applied weights of historical data is appropriately justified."
"120. In accordance with Article 179(1)(a) of the CRR, an institution's own estimates must incorporate all relevant data and must be derived using both historical experience and empirical evidence. To comply with these requirements, when institutions use external or pooled data to complement their own loss or recovery experience, they should ensure that LRA LGDs derived from external or pooled data are also calculated separately from those based on internal data. In addition, the direction and magnitude of the differences between these averages should be properly analysed and documented when calibrating the model, including the adequacy of the MoC considered, and duly followed up in the review of estimates."
"121. Article 179(1)(d) of the CRR requires, among other things, that the population of exposures represented in the data used for estimation, the lending standards used when the data were generated and other relevant characteristics must be comparable with those of the institution's exposures and standards. Paragraph 164 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD further specifies that institutions should take into account not only the current characteristics of the portfolio but also, where relevant, any changes to the structure of the portfolio that are expected to happen in the foreseeable future. When institutions perform adjustments to their LGD estimates in order to comply with these requirements, it is the ECB's understanding that the following principles should apply. (a) The adjustment should be based on a comparison of the data used in risk quantification with the institution's application portfolio. In many circumstances (for example where a type of product has been discontinued by the institution), the addition of these characteristics as risk drivers for LGD estimation is the most simple and effective way of dealing with issues of non-representativeness. (b) In the event of changes in lending or recovery policies, institutions should make only conservative adjustments until they are able to provide empirical evidence concerning the impact of the new policies. Such evidence should be based on the inclusion in the RDS of data from periods more recent than the change of policy. (c) All economic and market conditions experienced in the past and reflected in historical observations should be considered by institutions as part of foreseeable economic and market conditions (paragraph 147 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD). They are not, therefore, a reason to perform adjustments."

5.3.6 Downturn LGD
"122. To obtain LGD estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn in accordance with Article 181(1)(b) of the CRR, institutions are expected to: (a) characterise an economic downturn in accordance with the Final Draft RTS on the specification of the nature, severity and duration of an economic downturn; (b) derive LGD estimates which are appropriate for the downturn conditions specified, in accordance with the EBA Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (""Downturn LGD estimation"")."
5.4 Estimation of ELBE and LGD in-default
5.4.1 Relevant regulatory references
"123. In accordance with Article 181(1)(h) of the CRR, for the specific case of exposures already in default institutions must use the sum of their ELBE for each exposure, given current economic circumstances and exposure status and their estimate of the increased loss rate caused by possible additional unexpected losses during the recovery period. To comply with these requirements, institutions should estimate ELBE and LGD in-default under paragraphs 165 to 193 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. In this process, institutions should follow the observations below."
"124. In accordance with Article 181(1)(h) of the CRR, the ELBE must represent the best estimate of expected loss given current economic circumstances and exposure status. To comply with this requirement, it is the ECB's understanding that institutions should take into consideration the economic conditions expected over the period of the recovery process, and in particular reflect downturn conditions in the ELBE, if and only if current economic conditions are in a downturn or a downturn is expected over the period of the recovery process. This can be done either by adding the relevant macroeconomic and economic factors as drivers of the ELBE model under paragraph 183 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, or alternatively through an adjustment to the LRA as referred to in paragraph 184 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD."
"125. Under paragraph 193 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, LGD in-default can be estimated directly or as the sum of ELBE and an add-on capturing the unexpected loss related to the exposures in default that may occur during the recovery period. In particular, the following should be taken into consideration. (a) The use of a constant value for unexpected losses for all defaulted exposures is not risk sensitive. In the ECB's understanding, therefore, it does not allow an accurate assessment of risk. Where an institution does use a constant value, it should justify this. It should demonstrate that the constant value in question is an adequate estimate of all the components of unexpected loss envisaged in paragraph 193(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD during the remaining recovery period, i.e. between the date for which estimates are being applied and the final closure of the recovery process. This analysis should be performed at least for every calibration segment. (b) LGD in-default estimates are generally expected to be higher than ELBE estimates and only equal for duly justified individual exposures, which are expected to be very limited."

6 Conversion factors
"6.1 Commitments, unadvised limits and scope of application"
6.1.1 Relevant regulatory references
"126. In accordance with Article 151(7) and (8) of the CRR, institutions must use own estimates of CCFs for the retail exposure class. If they have received permission to use own estimates for the corporate, institutional, central government and central bank exposure classes, they must again use own estimates of CCFs, instead of the conversion factors set out in in Article 166(8)(a) to (d) of the CRR. In both cases (retail and non-retail exposure classes), the scope of CCF modelling is, in the ECB's understanding, limited to the off-balance sheet items referred to in Article 166(8) of the CRR. 56 The treatment of off-balance-sheet items other than those mentioned in Article 166(1) to (8) of the CRR is specified in Article 166(10). In accordance with Article 166(10) of the CRR, an exposure value must be a specific percentage of an off-balance-sheet item's value, based on the classification of off-balance-sheet items established in Annex I of the CRR."


"127. Conversion factor means the ratio of the currently undrawn amount of a commitment that could be drawn and that would therefore be outstanding at default to the currently undrawn amount of the commitment. The extent of the commitment is determined by the advised limit, unless the unadvised limit is higher. 57 The exposure value for the items listed in Article 166(8) of the CRR must be calculated as the committed but undrawn amount multiplied by a CCF. 58 To calculate the exposure value as required by Article 166(8) of the CRR, institutions should adopt the following approach. (a) Treat a facility as an exposure from the earliest date at which the facility is recorded in the institution's systems in a way that would allow the obligor to make a drawing. An unadvised limit is any credit limit defined by the institution (i) that is above the limit the obligor has been informed of by the institution; and (ii) according to which additional drawings are possible, at least temporarily. This higher (unadvised) credit limit may be disregarded if its availability is subject to a further credit assessment by the institution, as long as this additional assessment includes a re-rating or a confirmation of the rating of the obligor. (b) Consider as ""commitment"" any contractual arrangement that has been offered by the institution and accepted by the obligor to extend credit, purchase assets or issue credit substitutes. (c) Consider as ""conditionally cancellable commitment"" any such arrangement that can be and will be cancelled by the institution if the obligor fails to meet conditions set out in the facility documentation, including conditions that must be met by the obligor prior to any initial or subsequent drawdown under the arrangement. (d) Consider as ""credit lines"" all lines including products such as facilities granted for construction where the payments to the obligor are made according to the progress of the construction. Products such as guarantees are not, however, included in the concept of credit lines."
"128. For institutions not using own estimates of CCFs for exposures to corporates, institutions, central governments and central banks, Article 166(8) of the CRR defines the CCFs to be used for the purpose of calculating RWEA. In accordance with Article 166(8)(a) and (c) of the CRR, institutions not using their own estimates of CCFs for non-retail exposures are permitted to apply a 0% CCF, under certain conditions. It is the ECB's understanding that, to comply with the conditions established under Article 166(8)(a) and (c) of the CRR and to apply a 0% CCF, institutions should have in place internal control systems that allow them to monitor the obligor's financial condition and to act in the event that a deterioration in the obligor's credit quality is detected. They should also be able to provide evidence that the internal control systems work effectively. For this purpose, institutions should demonstrate that there is only a very limited number of exposures of a particular type observed during the previous year for which the EAD is higher than the drawn amount at the reference date. This analysis should be performed on a regular basis. The ECB considers it good practice when institutions perform this analysis on an annual basis."

6.2 Realised CCFs
6.2.1 Relevant regulatory references
"129. To ensure that a consistent and accurate approach is adopted to calculate the realised CCFs, institutions should have in place sufficiently detailed policies and procedures. For institutions to comply with the data-related requirements set out in Article 176(4) of the CRR, their RDS: (a) should not be capped at the principal amount outstanding or at facility limits; (b) should include all credit obligations (paragraph 16 of the EBA Guidelines on the definition of default), especially accrued interest, other due payments (e.g. fees) and limit excesses."
"130. In accordance with Article 182(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions must calculate the realised CCF at facility level for each default. In cases where realised LGD is calculated at a more aggregated level than single facility level, as described in paragraph 99 above, CCF estimation can be performed at facility level or at the LGD aggregation level. One such example is where CCF is estimated by facility while several facilities are aggregated for LGD purposes, since they are all secured by the same collateral. In this case, institutions should: (a) for retail exposures where they use the definition of default at facility level in accordance with the last paragraph of Article 178(1) of the CRR, apply full contagion of default across aggregated facilities; (b) ensure consistency between estimation and application of the parameters; (c) ensure that no bias results from the aggregation of facilities by validation of the estimates (PD, LGD, CCF) also at the more aggregated level."

"131. For the purposes of Article 182(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions must compute realised CCF. To comply with this requirement, in the understanding of the ECB institutions should adopt the following approach. (a) Calculate realised CCF as the ratio of the difference between the EAD and the exposure at the reference date in the numerator, and the difference between the limit at reference date and the exposure at reference date (i.e. the amount available to be drawn at the reference date) in the denominator. This does not mean that, to address the issues with the ""region of instability"", institutions may not use direct EAD realisation (as referred to in paragraph 137(a) of this chapter). (b) Ensure that the definition of exposure is identical to the one used for LGD estimation. In particular, treatment of post-default drawings should be identical for the exposures used in both the LGD and CCF estimations. Discounted additional drawings are expected to be included in CCF when they are included in the LGD denominator. See also paragraph 100(a) above. (c) For each reference date and in cases where the same facility defaults more than once during the observation period, consider as the date of default relevant for CCF purposes the date of the first default."
6.3 CCF structure
6.3.1 Relevant regulatory references
"132. To comply with the requirements for the structure of the CCF models established in Article 170 of the CRR, and particularly when considering the risk drivers envisaged by paragraph (4) of that Article, institutions should follow these principles: (a) Demonstrate a detailed understanding of the impact on the CCF model of changes in customer product mix or characteristics that take place between reference and default dates and the materiality of that impact. If the impact is material, institutions should address it within their own estimation process. This is because changes in exposure characteristics (e.g. a change in the value of the limit) or ""product profile transformations"" (e.g. a revolving loan that has been converted into a term loan or vice versa) which commonly occur between reference and default dates can impact the CCF model. (b) Although the reference date for the calculation of realised CCF should be up to 12 months prior to default, institutions should analyse risk drivers considering information not only at the reference date but also before that date whenever relevant. In assessing whether the use of information from before the reference date is relevant, institutions should take into account the volatility of the risk driver over time. (c) Ensure that the models reflect the institution's current policies and strategies regarding account monitoring, including limit monitoring, and payment processing."
6.4 CCF risk quantification
6.4.1 Relevant regulatory references
"133. The exposure value for undrawn commitments is calculated as the committed but undrawn amount multiplied by a CCF. 59 CCFs can also be derived from direct estimates (for example by modelling total facility EAD) in accordance with Article 169(3) of the CRR. In this case, and in order to comply with Article 182(1)(a) of the CRR, it is the ECB's understanding that institutions should also calculate the LRA CCF at a level more granular than calibration segment that is appropriate for the application of the model, namely using individual CCF values if estimation is discrete or sub-ranges of CCF values if estimation is continuous. In addition, institutions should ensure that there are no systematic deviations when comparing the estimated CCFs with the LRA realised CCFs in sub-ranges. In other words, the direction of divergences should be random."
"134. In accordance with Article 182(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions are required to calculate the default weighted LRA CCF separately for each facility grade or pool. To comply with this requirement, institutions should adopt the following approach. 59 (a) Ensure that the historical observation period is as broad as possible and contains data from different periods characterised by different economic circumstances, including bad years as reflected in economic indicators that are relevant for the type of exposures considered. (b) Calculate the observed average CCF for each facility grade or pool on all defaults observed in the historical observation period. Institutions should apply an appropriate treatment to extremely high values of realised CCF much above 100%, at the level of data quality, risk drivers, assignment to grades or pools or assignment to calibration segments. To ensure that the estimates are accurate, it is the ECB's understanding that institutions are not expected to cap realised CCF values. In other words, they are not expected to replace the observed value by a pre-defined value when the observed value is above the pre-defined one. (c) When the historical observation period is considered to be representative of the LRA, the average realised CCFs should be computed as the arithmetic average of the yearly averages of realised CCFs in that period. (d) When the historical observation period is not considered to be representative of the LRA: (e) (i) if bad years are under-represented in the historical observation period, the observed average CCF should be adjusted upwards in order to estimate an LRA CCF; (ii) if bad years are over-represented in the historical observation period, the observed average CCF may be adjusted to estimate an LRA CCF where there is a significant correlation between the economic indicators referred to in paragraph 122(a) and the available observed CCF. It is the ECB's understanding that, where CCF estimates for specific facility grades or pools are low or even zero (in exceptional cases) before the MoC is applied, and in order to ensure that these estimates are accurate and not driven by (systematic) errors or distortions, institutions should ensure that their estimation process is pertinent and accurate. In particular, they should ensure that, in these specific facility grades or pools, there is only a very limited number of exposures for which the exposure at the moment of default is higher than the drawn amount at the reference date, and that these outcomes are carefully monitored and scrutinised."

"135. Notwithstanding paragraph 134, for retail exposures an institution need not give equal importance to historical data if more recent data are a better predictor of drawdowns. In the ECB's understanding, an institution may consider that the more recent data are a better predictor of drawdowns and may give more importance to recent historical data if the following apply. (a) There is a significant improvement in predictive power when using the more recent data compared with the predictive power resulting from the use of an arithmetic average. This improvement can be evidenced by comparing the estimated CCFs for each grade with the average realised CCF covering as long a period as possible, as set out in Article 185(b) of the CRR. (b) The oldest data are considered as non-representative as a result of specific policy or business changes in the bank, but not in order to reflect current trends in realised CCFs directly related to macroeconomic conditions. (c) The weighting approach is used in a consistent manner over time and any change in the applied weights of historical data is appropriately justified."


"136. To comply with the requirements of Article 182(1)(b) and to have CCF estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn, institutions should characterise an economic downturn in accordance with the Final Draft RTS on the specification of the nature, severity and duration of an economic downturn. To this end, an impact assessment should be performed to identify which identified downturn period is most strongly evidenced by elevated levels of realised CCFs. Any lag between the downturn period and the date of the impact on the realised CCFs should be taken into account. This means that where high levels of realised CCFs are not experienced simultaneously with the downturn periods, but nevertheless result from it, these high CCFs should be considered as the CCFs appropriate for the economic downturn."
"137. In order to ensure a meaningful assessment of transaction characteristics, as required by Article 144(1)(a) of the CRR, particular attention should be given to the following observations. (a) A common issue in estimating CCFs concerns facilities close to being fully drawn at the relevant reference date, as a result of the instability that may be observed in the estimates (also known as ""region of instability""). To mitigate this risk, institutions should ensure that their CCF model is robust and provides estimates that are effectively protected against undesirable issues caused by the ""region of instability"" and/or that their estimates are adjusted adequately. (b) Article 182 of the CRR lays down the requirements for CCF estimates. In cases where institutions apply a fixed yet conservatively specified CCF (e.g. 100%), the ECB considers them to be compliant with the requirements when these estimates are applied in specific circumstances, such as scarcity of data and low materiality of the scope of application, for example in the event that the facility has no on-balance exposure until the first disbursement and estimates are monitored and validated."
7 Model-related MoC
7.1 Relevant regulatory references
"138. Institutions must add to their estimates an MoC that is related to the expected range of estimation errors. 60 To comply with this requirement, institutions are expected to follow paragraphs 36 to 52 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD."
"139. Since the MoC requirements laid down by the CRR also apply in cases where institutions estimate CCFs, paragraph 138 is also relevant in such cases."
"140. In the understanding of the ECB, to reflect the dispersion of the statistical estimators as set out in paragraph 43(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, institutions should adopt the following approach. (a) For PD, estimate an MoC to account for statistical uncertainty/sampling error affecting the LRA estimate at grade/pool level. This MoC should be based on the distribution of the estimator, which is the average of one-year default rates of the grade/pool across time (i.e. the distribution of (sum DR t )/T, considering that the uncertainty is primarily driven by the statistical uncertainty of each one-year default rate and the length of the time series. As a result, it is expected that the lower the number of observations per grade and the shorter the time series are, the higher the MoC of the grade should be. Institutions need to be aware of and deal adequately with the dependency between default rates over time on the quantification of the MoC, e.g. when using overlapping windows for the calculation of default rates. The above principles also apply for institutions using direct PD estimates and for institutions calibrating the LRA default rate at the level of the calibration segment, as referred to in paragraph 92(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. When using direct PD estimates, the MoC is based on the distribution of this direct PD estimator (which includes the risk differentiation function), implicitly reflecting the uncertainty of the LRA. When calibration is performed at calibration segment level, the general estimation error may be computed at that level when the statistical uncertainty/sampling error is not significantly different across grades or PD sub-ranges. (b) Similarly, for LGD and CCF, estimate an MoC to account for statistical uncertainty/sampling error affecting the final estimates. This MoC should be defined on the basis of the distribution of the estimators, considering that their uncertainty is primarily driven by the statistical uncertainty of the observations used to compute the long-run and downturn estimates and the length of the time series."

8 Review of estimates
8.1 Relevant regulatory references
"141. Institutions must review their estimates whenever new information comes to light but at least on an annual basis. 61 To comply with this requirement, they are expected to have in place a framework under paragraphs 217 to 221 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD."
"142. Since the review of estimates requirements under the CRR also apply in cases where an institution estimates CCFs, paragraph 141 is also relevant to such cases."
"143. In the ECB's understanding and for the purposes of paragraph 141, the following principles apply. (a) For PD models and regarding the analysis of the predictive power envisaged by paragraph 218(c) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD: (i) the analysis should be performed at grade level; for institutions using direct PD estimates, it should be performed at a sufficient level of granularity; (ii) institutions should use a range of metrics to assess predictive ability, including statistical tests and graphical analysis of the evolution of default rates and PD. (b) The analysis referred to in paragraph 218(c)(i) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD should also consider, for CCFs, whether including the most recent data leads to a significant change in the LRA CCF or downturn CCF. (c) For LGD models that result from a combination of different components (for example, secured and unsecured components), the back-testing analysis referred to in paragraph 218(c)(ii) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD should be run at both component and facility level. (d) In addition, institutions should consider in their frameworks for the review of estimates the availability of data for different exposure types, taking into account the specificities of the model architecture, including the existing and potential risk drivers, under paragraph 220 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. When data are scarce, they should use complementary analyses for those exposure types where quantitative measures prove inconclusive as a result, for example, of the low number of exposures available. (e) Where internal data are not considered sufficient to establish fixed targets and tolerances for defined metrics and tools to assess the performance of the PD model in terms of risk differentiation, institutions should define and put in place the appropriate actions to address this. 62 These actions could encompass, for example, the use of complementary analyses for those cases where the results for the application of metrics and tools are proven to be inconclusive. (f) When external credit bureau scores or ratings are used as the main (or one of the main) driver(s) of the internal rating, in cases where significant changes are applied to the credit bureau scoring institutions should consider the possibility of adjusting their internal data following the changes applied to the score, and whenever the input variables are no longer considered appropriate in their credit rating process."

"144. In the case of material models where the assignment of the grade is based on a statistical model and where there is a risk that slight changes in the ranking of the obligors, or in the boundaries between grades, could lead to significant changes in the RWEA in that portfolio, the framework referred to in paragraph 141 should also include an analysis of whether the inclusion of the most recent data in the RDS used for model development would lead to materially different model outcomes. This analysis should be conducted on a three-yearly basis, or more often, depending on the materiality of the model. The analysis should consider, in particular, whether the discriminatory power of the PD, LGD or CCF models would be materially increased when re-estimating the model parameters on the basis of the updated RDS. Portfolios should be considered as falling into this category when, for example: (i) a limited number of obligors represent an important share of the total exposure; or (ii) exposures are concentrated near the boundaries between two grades."

"145. When the number of default observations is low, to analyse whether the main drivers of the observed defaults are appropriately reflected in the model in accordance with Article 179(1)(a) of the CRR 63 institutions should analyse individual defaults (or at least a sample of them where the number of defaults makes analysing all of them unduly burdensome). However, the model should not be adapted simply to fit singular events from the institution's file review."
"146. In accordance with Article 172(3) of the CRR, for grade and pool assignments institutions must document those situations in which human judgement may override the inputs or outputs of the assignment process. In addition, institutions must complement the statistical model by human judgement and human oversight to review model-based assignments and ensure that the models are used appropriately. 64 Furthermore, review procedures must be designed to find and limit errors associated with model weaknesses. 65 To comply with these requirements, institutions should assess the impact of the application of human judgement on risk differentiation capability (e.g. on discriminatory power), under paragraph 218(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD."
9 Calculation of maturity for non-retail exposures
9.1 Relevant regulatory references
"147. For the cases described in Article 162(2)(f) of the CRR, the maturity parameter (M) must be the maximum remaining time (in years) that the obligor is permitted to take to fully discharge its contractual obligations. In the ECB's understanding, M should be calculated using the expiry date of a facility. The repayment date of a current drawn amount should not be used."
"148. To ensure that the calculation of the maturity parameter is correct and to avoid any possible errors, for the purposes of Article 162(3) of the CRR institutions should adequately justify and document any exemptions from the one-year maturity floor."
