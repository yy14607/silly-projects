# Sraping the EBA regulations

This little project was inspired by the need to create regulatory checklists for IRB models. 
To avoid copy-pasting enormous contents of the regulations into excel files, I wrote scripts to 'scrape' the contents of the regulations.

Currently done regulations:
CRR;

To-do:
all the RTS's.

Unfortunately, some of the guidelines are in pdf format and I could not find an online version (for example https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/ecb/pub/pdf/ssm.guidetointernalmodels_consolidated_201910~97fd49fb08.en.pdf).
Still trying to figure out how to scrape those.
