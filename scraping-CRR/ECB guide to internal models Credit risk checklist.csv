,1 Scope of the credit risk chapter,,,,
,,,,1,"The purpose of this chapter is to provide transparency on how the ECB understands a number of topics related to internal models used for the IRB approach, including an initial section covering data maintenance for this approach. It is important to note that this chapter does not aim to cover exhaustively all topics of the CRR for the IRB approach that could be subject to review during internal model investigations. On these selected topics, the chapter is aligned with the EBA GL on PD and LGD."
,2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach,,,,
,,2.1 Relevant regulatory references,,,
,,,,2,"In accordance with Article 144(1) of the CRR, an institution's systems for the management and rating of credit risk exposures must be sound and implemented with integrity. In particular, the institution must collect and store all relevant data to provide effective support to its credit risk measurement and management processes. The ECB understands that, in order to comply with these requirements, institutions should deploy robust, well-documented and adequately tested IT systems, together with sound data management practices."
,,,,3,"Consequently, this section of the guide sets out the principles regarding the following elements for the management of IRB data: (a) IT systems: infrastructure and implementation testing; (b) policies, roles and responsibilities in data processing and data quality management; (c) components of the data quality management framework."
,,2.2 IT systems: infrastructure and implementation testing,,,
,,,2.2.1 Infrastructure,,
,,,,4,"Sound and robust IT infrastructures play an essential role in supporting the institution's rating systems. In addition, and in accordance with Article 175(1) of the CRR, institutions must document the design and operational details of their rating systems."
,,,,5,"With regard to the soundness and robustness of institutions' IT infrastructure, the ECB considers that Article 78(2) and (3) of the Final Draft RTS on assessment methodology for IRB provides a good understanding of the elements that institutions should take into account in order to comply with the data-related requirements of the CRR."
,,,,6,"Furthermore, to comply with the documentation requirements for the rating systems as established under Article 144(1)(e) and Article 175(1) of the CRR, it is the ECB's view that institutions should document and keep an updated register of all current and past versions of the following elements of a rating system: (a) the model's data flow (from data entry to reporting and for both historical data and current exposure data), identifying the relevant workflows and procedures relating to data extraction, data collection, data storage and data transformations; (b) the relevant sources of data and the global map of IT systems and databases involved in the calculation systems used for the purposes of the IRB approach; (c) the relevant functional specification of IT systems and databases, including their size, date of construction and data dictionaries, specifying the content of the fields and of the different valid data values that could be inserted in them, with clear definitions of data items; (d) the relevant technical specification of IT systems and databases, including the type of database, tables, database management system, database architecture, and data models given in any standard data modelling notation; (e) the audit trail for critical IT systems and databases. To allow an independent knowledgeable third party to obtain a detailed outline of the different IT elements of the rating systems, the documentation produced by the institution should be clear and understandable. To comply with the requirement to document its rating system and the rationale for its design, the institution should keep the register of all rating systems, including all current and past versions of rating systems, updated for a period of at least three years and, whenever necessary, an extended period beyond that. This is also reflected in Article 33(1) of the Final Draft RTS on assessment methodology for IRB. In any case, the institution should ensure that the elements mentioned in paragraph 6(a) to (e) for the current rating system are adequately recorded in the register and enable a clear understanding of all relevant data of the current rating system that must be stored by the institution."
,,,2.2.2 Implementation testing,,
,,,,7,"In order to ensure the integrity and robustness of IT systems and in particular that, in terms of IT, the implementation of the models is successful and errorfree, institutions should have in place a consistent process for testing the relevant IRB systems and applications upon first implementation and on an ongoing basis. This IT-testing process should be clearly defined and documented in an organisation-wide policy and procedure."
,,,,8,"To achieve its objective the policy should consider all potential events that should trigger a testing procedure and their impact on the tests to be conducted. The trigger events that should be considered include: software releases or material IT-related changes, regulatory changes, model methodology changes and the extension of the range of application of a rating system."
,,,,9,"IT implementation tests to be considered include the following: (a) unit/component/module tests; (b) integration tests (of units and between systems); (c) system tests (this includes functionality, performance - in normal and stress scenarios and security and portability tests); (d) user acceptance testing (functional testing); (e) regression testing."
,,,,10,"In principle, the unit(s) responsible for performing the implementation tests should be clearly identified and the results of the tests should be documented. It is the ECB's view that as a general rule institutions should develop a standardised format for the documentation of test results."
,,"2.3 Policies, roles and responsibilities in data processing and data quality management",,,
,,,,11,"For institutions to be able to comply with the requirement to collect and store all relevant data established under Article 144(1)(d) of the CRR, it is the ECB's understanding that policies and rules on data management should be defined at group level for both of the following aspects: data processing (i.e. data collection, storage, validation, migration, actualisation and use), and data quality management (see Section 2.4 of this chapter)."
,,,,12,"As for data processing, and in particular with regard to manual interventions and data transfers, the following principles should be considered: (a) to ensure that all data transformations are traceable and controlled, general guidelines and rules should be clearly formalised with regard to manual interventions within the data processing; (b) to ensure timeliness and accountability, all data transfers should be formally agreed upon (for example by means of service level agreements) by data providers and data users (for both outsourced and in-house processes)."
,,,,13,"To ensure the integrity of the data processes, the policies and rules on data management should clearly set out the relevant data governance arrangements. It is also expected that these policies and rules will specify the different roles and responsibilities assigned to data management. These include data quality roles and responsibilities for both business owners and IT functions and data and systems ownership throughout the entire credit risk modelling life cycle (including all IT systems used). These policies should take into account the following principles. (a) The responsibilities of business owners include: (i) ensuring data are correctly entered, kept up-to-date and aligned with the institution's data definitions; (ii) ensuring that data aggregation capabilities and reporting practices are consistent with the institution's policies (b) IT functions are responsible for supporting the operation of the systems for data collection, processing, transformation and storage during the entire life cycle of the data. (c) Different business owners and IT systems owners may be appointed throughout the data life cycle. However, each data source, IT system and process step should have an assigned business owner and/or IT systems owner that can be formally identified."
,,2.4 Data quality management framework,,,
,,,,14,"Institutions must have in place a process for vetting data inputs into the model. This must include an assessment of the accuracy, completeness and appropriateness of the data. To comply with this requirement and to ensure the quality of the data used for credit risk measurement and management processes, it is the ECB's view that institutions should establish and implement an effective data quality management framework that is formalised in a set of policies and procedures. This framework should be applicable to all data used in IRB-related processes, i.e. internal data, external data and pooled data, if any. In addition, it should ensure that reliable risk information is available to enable an institution's risk profile to be assessed accurately and drive sound decision-making within the institution and by external stakeholders, including competent authorities."
,,,,15,"The ECB considers that the data quality management framework is effective when it encompasses the following components: (a) sound underlying governance principles (see Section 2.4.1 of this chapter), particularly those relating to the allocation and fulfilment of roles and responsibilities for the management of data quality in a manner that ensures that data quality management activities are independent of data processing activities; (b) a description of the scope in terms of risk data coverage (see Section 2.4.2); (c) data quality standards covering all relevant data quality dimensions, i.e. completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness, uniqueness, validity, availability and traceability (see Section 2.4.3); (d) consistent criteria and a systematic metrics approach to assess compliance with data quality standards; this should be supported by sufficient data quality controls along the entire IRB data chain (see Section 2.4.4); (e) procedures for constantly assessing and improving the quality of data (see Section 2.4.5); (f) reporting procedures on data quality allowing for sufficient understanding of the quality of the data supporting the IRB models (see Section 2.4.6). The following sections further develop the above-mentioned elements."
,,,2.4.1 Governance principles for the data quality management framework,,
,,,,16,"The data quality management framework: (a) should be approved by the institution's management body or a designated committee thereof and senior management as part of their responsibilities; (b) should be distributed throughout the organisation to the relevant staff; (c) should be regularly assessed in order to verify its adequacy, and be updated and improved whenever necessary; (d) should be subject to regular review by the internal audit function or another comparable independent auditing unit."
,,,,17,"The roles of the different units, internal bodies and staff involved in the data quality management process should be defined in such a way as to ensure that the data handling process is sufficiently independent of the data quality management process."
,,,,18,"The ECB considers it good practice for institutions to have a dedicated independent unit with an overall view of and responsibility for the management of data quality. Where an independent unit is established, the size of this unit should be proportionate to the nature, size and degree of complexity of the institution's business and organisational structure."
,,,2.4.2 Scope of the data quality management framework,,
,,,,19,"The data quality management framework: (a) should cover all relevant data quality dimensions: completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness, uniqueness, validity, availability and traceability (see paragraph 21); (b) should cover the whole data life cycle, from data entry to reporting, and encompass both historical data and current application databases."
,,,,20,"If institutions use data provided by third parties, the ECB considers it good practice for them to ensure that the third party has data quality processes in place to ensure the accuracy, completeness and appropriateness of the data provided."
,,,2.4.3 Data quality standards in the data quality management framework,,
,,,,21,"In accordance with Article 174(b) of the CRR, institutions must implement a process for vetting data inputs into the model which must include an assessment of the accuracy, completeness and appropriateness of data. The ECB understands that, in order to comply with this requirement, institutions should establish data quality standards that set the objectives and overall scope of the data quality management process. To this end, these standards should be defined for the following data quality dimensions for all data inputs into the model and at each stage of the data life cycle: (a) completeness (values are present in any attributes that require them); (b) accuracy (data are substantively error-free); (c) consistency (a given set of data can be matched across the institution's different data sources); (d) timeliness (data values are up-to-date); (e) uniqueness (aggregate data are free from any duplication arising from filters or other transformations of source data); (f) validity (data are founded on an adequate and rigorous classification system that ensures their acceptance); (g) availability/accessibility (data are made available to the relevant stakeholders); (h) traceability (the history, processing and location of the data under consideration can be easily traced)."
,,,2.4.4 Data quality controls,,
,,,,22,Data quality should be measured in an integrated and systematic way. The measurement system and the frequency of its application should be formalised.
,,,,23,Indicators and their corresponding tolerance levels and thresholds should be set in order to monitor compliance with the standards established and should be combined with visual systems (e.g. red/amber/green traffic-light system) and dashboards for monitoring and reporting purposes.
,,,,24,"Indicators should be supported by effective and sufficient data quality checks and controls throughout the data life cycle, from data entry to reporting, and for both historical data and current application data. Data quality checks and controls should include reconciliation across and within systems, including between accounting and IRB data. An effective control framework should therefore be in place to ensure that sound controls and related procedures are implemented, especially for manual processes."
,,,2.4.5 Remediation of data quality issues,,
,,,,25,A process for the identification and remediation of data quality deficiencies should be in place in order to constantly improve data quality and promote compliance with the data quality standards.
,,,,26,"Data quality assessments should be carried out independently (see paragraphs 17 and 18) and recommendations should be issued with an indication of their priority, based on the materiality of the incidents identified. All such data quality incidents should be recorded and monitored. For each of the data quality incidents, an owner responsible for resolving the incident should be appointed and an action plan for dealing with the incident drawn up on the basis of the priority assigned. Remediation timelines should depend on the severity and impact of the incident and the implementation timelines required to resolve it. Data quality incidents should be resolved at source level or, if this is not possible, mitigated by taking a prudent approach."
,,,2.4.6 Data quality reporting,,
,,,,27,"In accordance with Article 189(2)(c) of the CRR, the institution's senior management must ensure, on an ongoing basis, that the ratings systems are working properly. To accomplish this, the ECB understands that a formal reporting process on the quality of risk data should be in place with the objective of improving the quality of data and enabling an assessment of the potential impact of data quality in own fund requirements calculations. In general, this reporting should be presented in a standardised format with clear and concise content, including the following: (a) comprehensive overview of the performance of the model in terms of data quality, including external data and pooled data, if any, at all stages of the IRB life cycle, from data entry to reporting, for both historical data and current exposure data; (b) findings and, where applicable, recommendations to address detected weaknesses or shortfalls; (c) sufficient and appropriate evidence that the recommendations have been adequately addressed and properly implemented (e.g. by means of a status report). From the source system in which the incidents are present down to the IRB datasets or systems."
,,,,28,"In accordance with Article 189(1) of the CRR, the management body or a designated committee thereof and senior management must possess a general understanding of the rating systems of the institution and a detailed comprehension of its associated management reports. To comply with this requirement, the ECB understands that reports on the quality of risk data should be submitted to these parties. In addition, the ECB considers it good practice for these reports to also be submitted to all other relevant staff, including modellers, internal validation, internal audit, data quality managers, data owners and other business units involved."
,,,,29,"Data quality reports should be produced and submitted to senior management more frequently than annually to enable senior management to ensure, on an ongoing basis, that the rating systems are operating properly in accordance with Article 189(2)(c) of the CRR."
,3 Use of data,,,,
,,3.1 Relevant regulatory references,,,
,,,,30,"In accordance with Article 144(1)(d) of the CRR, institutions must collect and store all relevant data to provide effective support to their credit risk measurement and management processes. Furthermore, good data quality is a fundamental condition for developing a robust rating system. The ECB considers that, to comply with these requirements and ensure the quality of data, institutions should have sound policies, processes and methods in place, under paragraphs 15 to 34 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD for assessing and improving the quality and representativeness of the data used in the modelling and risk quantification process."
,,,,31,"Since the data-related requirements of the CRR also apply in cases where an institution estimates CCFs, paragraph 30 is also relevant for such institutions."
,,3.2 Use of external data,,,
,,,,32,"Data-related requirements established under the CRR apply to all data: internal, external or pooled. In the ECB's understanding, therefore, paragraph 30 is also relevant in the event that an institution uses external or pooled data. The principles on the collection and storage of data are relevant to the institutions' own data and to the data received from the pool."
,,,,33,"To ensure that credit risk management and measurement processes are built on appropriate data, for the purposes of risk differentiation, risk quantification and review of estimates institutions should assess whether external data can be used to complement internal data when they consider they do not have sufficient available internal data."
,,,,34,"In addition, when institutions use different data sources (including different external databases, whether or not combined with internal data) for the purpose of risk quantification, there could be a risk that the sources include common obligors among the data sources used for risk quantification. This could lead to bias or double-counting effects in the calculation of one-year default rates. To avoid this risk, institutions should develop the necessary processes in order to identify common obligors within these databases and ensure that each common obligor is only taken into account once in the calculation of one-year default rates. When institutions are not able to identify common obligors, they should analyse potential bias or double-counting effects in the calculation of one-year default rates. These bias or double-counting effects should be reflected appropriately in the computation of one-year default rates and long-run average (LRA) default rates."
,,,,35,"If an institution uses statistical models and other mechanical methods to assign exposures to obligors or facilities grades or pools, the data used to build the model must be representative of the population of the institution's actual obligors or facilities. If external data are used, the same requirements with regard to representativeness must be applicable vis-a-vis the bank's portfolio or portfolio subset for which the external data are used."
,,,,36,"Proving representativeness in cases where an institution uses external data is generally more difficult, as internal data are scarce. If an institution cannot provide sufficient proof that the external data are representative, in the ECB's view it may still use external data if it shows (by quantitative analysis and/or qualitative argumentation) that the information gained from the use of the external data outweighs any drawbacks stemming from the deficiencies identified and an appropriate margin of conservatism (MoC) is applied. In particular, institutions should provide evidence that the model's performance does not deteriorate when including information derived from the external data, and that the parameter estimates are not biased. To assess these issues, the institution should conduct quantitative and qualitative analyses specifically designed for this purpose."
,,,,37,"In accordance with Article 174(b) of the CRR, if an institution uses statistical models and other mechanical methods to assign exposures to obligors or facilities grades or pools, it must have in place a process for vetting data inputs to the model, which should include an assessment of the accuracy, completeness and appropriateness of the data. In addition, and in accordance with Article 179(1)(a), in quantifying the risk parameters to be associated with rating grades or pools institutions must incorporate all relevant data, information and methods. To comply with these requirements, institutions should ensure that, when external data are used for risk differentiation, risk quantification or review of estimates, they know the data sources and the most relevant data processing operations of the variables acting as direct model inputs performed by the data provider. Institutions should be able to differentiate between internal and external data and to document which information is internal and which information is received from external data sources. To ensure that the data remain appropriate, institutions should provide an adequate rationale in the event that, for the purpose of risk differentiation, risk quantification or review of estimates, they modify the external data acquired, select only part of a wider external database or use different external providers."
,,3.3 Use of external bureau scores or external ratings as input variables in the rating process,,,
,,,,38,"Where an institution uses external credit bureau scores or external ratings as input variables in the rating process, and in particular when externally sourced scores are the main (or one of the main) input variable(s) of the overall internal rating, there is a risk that an internal model may not consider all relevant information. In the ECB's understanding, institutions mitigate this risk when they comply with the following principles. (a) The external scores or ratings and/or data are regularly updated or refreshed, especially where credit bureau information is dynamic and is used not only for the application rating but also for the ongoing behavioural rating. (b) Institutions understand the structure and nature of external scores or ratings and their key drivers. They also regularly verify that the results of the credit bureau score continue to be appropriate input variables in their credit rating process, for example by reviewing any changes in the credit bureau score methodology. The greater the importance of the external scores or ratings, the greater understanding institutions should demonstrate of their structure, nature and key drivers and the higher the frequency that should be considered in monitoring the appropriateness of these external scores or ratings. (c) Validation requirements are similar to those applied to other internal and external input variables. (d) Even when the external score or rating is the main (or one of the main) driver(s) of the internal rating, the institution ensures that all relevant internal information regarding the creditworthiness of the obligor is taken into account with sufficient weighting in the internal rating. In addition, the institution demonstrates that the additional relevant internal information considered in the model and its weighting are sufficient to ensure that the internal rating does not merely take on the results of the external bureau scores or the external ratings used. (e) When institutions make use of external scores or ratings or any other judgement-based assessment provided by a third party as input variables in the rating process, they should ensure that any potential correlation between the relevant risk drivers does not lead to bias or a doublecounting effect in the risk parameter estimates. This can be especially relevant in these cases, due to the potential use of duplicated information. (f) The institution remains responsible for the performance of the model."
,,3.4 Use of pooled data,,,
,,,,39,"The use of pooled data is treated similarly to the situation where internal data are combined with data derived from a different (and external) set of obligors or facilities, as mentioned in Section 3.2."
,,,,40,"In accordance with Article 179(2)(a) of the CRR, where an institution uses data that are pooled across institutions the rating systems and criteria of other institutions in the pool must be similar to its own. To comply with this requirement an institution should, among other things: (a) ensure that there is a common definition of the key drivers and processes; (b) ensure that policies and procedures considered for human judgement, including overrides, can be applied in a comparable and similar manner across all participating institutions."
,,3.5 Use of purchased rating systems or models (pool models),,,
,,,,41,"In accordance with the last sentence of Article 144(1) of the CRR, the requirements to use an IRB approach, including own estimates and CCFs, apply also where an institution has implemented a rating system, or model used within a rating system, that it has purchased from a third-party vendor. To comply with this provision, institutions should ensure in such cases that all relevant internal information for model development and parameter calibration is taken into account. In particular, LRAs of default rates, LGD and CCFs based only on internal data should always be computed and considered for calibration. The institution remains responsible for the performance of the rating system or model."
,,,,42,"In addition, to ensure the integrity of the rating systems or internal models when institutions make use of pool models, and to comply with Article 144(1) of the CRR, the principles set out below should be followed. (a) If PD estimates are calculated using pooled data, institutions should verify that the data used for risk quantification meet the data requirements for default rate calculation as clarified in paragraph 80 below, or that the data are adjusted accordingly. (b) Where several institutions use a common pool model, each should ensure that its rating process is aligned to the extent that all input risk drivers are defined in the same way across all participating institutions. The institutions should also ensure that all assessments of the qualitative components of the rating model are performed in a comparable manner. (c) If a pool model is used for the estimation of risk parameters and the model-relevant parts of the process for managing distressed obligors (including the strategy before and after default) of the participating institutions are not aligned, these differences should be appropriately taken into account within the model or through an appropriate adjustment, in accordance with paragraph 37(a)(viii) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. In the case of a pool model for the estimation of LGD parameters, differences in the model-relevant parts of the workout processes should also be taken into account within the model or through an appropriate adjustment. (d) Institutions should ensure that all relevant internal information with respect to the creditworthiness of an obligor is taken into account and the rating is updated with new information in a timely manner. (e) Each institution should remain responsible for the performance of the rating model on its own portfolio."
,,,,43,"To ensure that its ratings systems are operating properly on an ongoing basis, if an institution introduces systematic adjustments to the outputs of the pool model, the institution concerned should initiate internal procedures to analyse whether significant weaknesses in the model exist and whether a model change needs to be triggered."
,,3.6 Consistency in the definition of default,,,
,,,,44,"In accordance with Article 178(4) of the CRR, institutions that use external data that are not in themselves consistent with the definition of default laid down in paragraph 1 of that Article must make appropriate adjustments to achieve broad equivalence with the definition of default. To comply with this requirement, institutions should ensure that when they make use of external data or pooled data they have a complete understanding of the definition of default applied to these data and perform a comparison between the definition of default used and the requirements of Article 178 of the CRR. If there are differences between the definition of default applied in the external or pooled data and the institution's own definition of default, the institution should assess the differences and describe the adjustments made to the risk estimates, in order to achieve the required level of consistency with the internal definition of default. It should also include an appropriate MoC to account for the adjustments included. These adjustments should be appropriately documented and justified, in particular by providing reasonable assurance that they do not undermine the validity of the approach for the purposes of risk differentiation and risk quantification."
,,3.7 Use of human judgement,,,
,,,,45,"In accordance with Article 171(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions must have specific definitions, processes and criteria for assigning exposures to grades or pools. The grade and pool definitions must be sufficiently detailed. To comply with this provision, institutions should ensure that, when human judgement is used in the assignment of exposures to grades or pools, there is a framework in place that establishes clear and detailed guidelines and procedures on the application of human judgement (e.g. through the use of pre-defined questionnaires). The use of human judgement should be documented in a way that ensures the rating assignment can be understood and replicated by a third party. To ensure the replicability and consistency of the rating assignment process, the principles set out below should be followed. (a) The basic structure of the model should be applied consistently and not modified by human judgement. It should, in particular, consist of: (i) the minimum data sources to be used for the grade/pool assignment; (ii) the complete list of pre-defined risk drivers which need to be assessed individually and for which the assessments need to be stored; (iii) the importance of and the evaluation criteria for the risk drivers, particularly the functional relationship between risk drivers and the assigned rating (before overrides); (iv) the procedures and steps to be followed during the assessment, including the steps where overrides can be applied. (b) Institutions should assess the consistency of the rating assignment process. To this end, they should define the tests and analyses in a way that is proportionate to the degree of human judgement applied. In cases where human judgement is the main component of the rating assignment process, these tests should at least include an analysis of consistency in a representative sample by having obligors re-rated independently by different analysts. The results of the ratings consistency assessment should be analysed against pre-defined thresholds as part of the framework for review of estimates."
,,,,46,"In accordance with Article 172(3) of the CRR, for grade and pool assignments institutions must document the situations in which human judgement may override the inputs or outputs of the assignment process and the personnel responsible for approving these overrides. In the context of this requirement, the ECB understands that an override is a judgement-based and discretionary action that contributes to the assessment of the obligor's creditworthiness as obtained through pre-defined components of the rating system. These comprise both automatic/quantitative components and qualitative variables. An override constitutes a direct intervention to an input or to an intermediate or final output of the rating assignment process, through an adjustment or replacement of that input or intermediate/final output which is obtained under the regular assignment process. Overrides should be limited to information relevant to the obligor's creditworthiness, if this is not captured well by the predefined components of the model."
,,,,47,"Within a rating assignment process, the use of pre-defined risk drivers in the form of qualitative model inputs should be distinguished from overrides. These judgement-based or qualitative variables are expected to be considered under the regular assignment process and as part of the pre-defined components of the rating system. Therefore, they are not themselves considered as overrides."
,,,,48,"Whenever the functional relationship between the risk drivers and the assigned rating as specified in paragraph 45(a)(iii) is circumvented, for example in cases where the last-assigned rating deviates from the rating that would be assigned on the basis of this functional relationship, it is considered to be an override. For the purposes of Article 172(3) of the CRR, it should therefore be specified in the policies and criteria for the use of overrides in the rating assignment process."
,,,,49,"In accordance with Article 174(e) of the CRR, the results of the statistical model must be complemented by human judgement, especially by taking into account all information not included in the model. The higher the number of relevant observations, the more the institution should rely on the outcomes of the statistical model."
,,,,50,"In addition, when human judgement is used for the purpose of model development, for example in setting the model's assumptions, the identification of risk drivers and determination of their weights, or the identification and combination of model components, there is a risk of the model-based assignments being inaccurate. To mitigate this risk, institutions should ensure that the incorporation of human judgement is appropriately managed and proportionate to the number of relevant available observations."
,,,,51,"For the purposes of quantifying the risk parameters to be associated with grades or pools, estimates must not be based purely on judgemental considerations. To this end, where human judgement is used to a greater extent because of the low number of relevant available observations, institutions should apply a higher MoC to their estimates to account for additional uncertainty."
,,,,52,"In addition, whenever human judgement is used in the estimation of risk parameters (for either risk differentiation or risk quantification purposes) institutions are expected to have in place a framework under paragraph 35 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD."
,4 Probability of default,,,,
,,4.1 Structure of PD models,,,
,,,4.1.1 Relevant regulatory references,,
,,,,53,"In accordance with Article 179(1)(a) of the CRR, estimates must be based on the material drivers of the risk parameters. The relevant material risk drivers and rating criteria may be taken into consideration in several ways: (a) when assigning exposures to different PD models; (b) at a PD model level when assigning exposures to different ranking/scoring methods; (c) as explanatory variables in ranking/scoring methods; (d) as drivers in the process for the assignment of PDs to grades or pools (e.g. calibration segments)."
,,,,54,"When choosing the risk drivers for the models, there is a risk that risk drivers that capture the characteristics of defaulted obligors could be inappropriately inferred as relevant risk drivers for the portfolio. To mitigate this risk, institutions should take appropriate measures against model misspecification with regard to overfitting. This is particularly relevant where default data for the development of the model are scarce."
,,,,55,"In accordance with Article 144(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions' rating systems must provide for a meaningful assessment of obligor and transaction characteristics, a meaningful differentiation of risk and accurate and consistent quantitative estimates of risk. To comply with this requirement, it is the ECB's understanding that PD models should perform adequately on economically significant and material sub-ranges of application. The sub-ranges are identified by splitting the full range of application of the PD model into different parts on the basis of potential drivers for risk differentiation, including the following non-exhaustive list of drivers, where relevant: (a) for PD models covering exposures to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs): country, industry (e.g. statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community (abbreviated as NACE) code section classification A to U), size of obligor (e.g. different buckets in terms of total assets), past delinquency (e.g. obligors with delinquency events, i.e. days past due, in the last 12 months); (b) for PD models covering retail exposures: client type (e.g. high net worth/private banking, other individuals, self-employed, SMEs), product type (e.g. consumer credit, credit card, other), region (e.g. nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) 1, 2 or 3 as defined by Eurostat), past delinquency (e.g. obligors with delinquency events, i.e. days past due, in the last 12 months), maturity (e.g. original or remaining maturity); (c) for PD models covering retail exposures secured by real estate: region (e.g. NUTS 1, 2 or 3 as defined by Eurostat), type of real estate (e.g. residential, commercial, other), past delinquency (e.g. obligors with delinquency events, i.e. days past due, in the last 12 months), maturity (e.g. original or remaining maturity); (d) for PD models covering exposures to financial institutions: business model (deposit-taking institutions, investment banking, insurance firms, other), jurisdiction (or global region as appropriate) and size (defined buckets of total assets); (e) for PD models covering exposures to large corporates: industry (e.g. NACE code section classification A to U), country (or global region as appropriate) and size (defined buckets of total turnover)."
,,,,56,"In accordance with Article 169(1) of the CRR, where an institution uses multiple rating systems, the rationale for assigning an obligor or a transaction to a rating system must be documented and applied in a manner that appropriately reflects the level of risk. To comply with this requirement institutions should, in terms of the range of application of a PD model: (a) clearly describe its range of application (and sub-divisions into different ranking/scoring methods and calibration segments) and also include an explanation of the risk drivers which the institution considered when designing the process but has decided not to use for the assignment of the obligor to the rating system; (b) ensure that there are no overlaps in the range of application of different PD models and that each obligor or facility to which the IRB approach should be applied can be clearly assigned to one particular PD model."
,,,4.1.2 Risk differentiation,,
Principles for all model types,,,,,
,,,,57,"Article 170 of the CRR lays down requirements related to the structure of rating systems. To comply with these requirements and with reference to Articles 36 to 38 of the Final Draft RTS on assessment methodology for IRB, institutions should, among other things, ensure a meaningful differentiation of risk over time which takes into account (i) the distribution of obligors or facilities; (ii) the homogeneity of obligors or facilities assigned to the same grade or pool; and (iii) the different levels of risk across obligors or facilities assigned to different grades or pools to which a different PD is applied."
,,,,58,"To ensure that the PD model performs adequately in terms of risk differentiation, institutions should adopt the following approach. (a) Define metrics (considering both their evolution over time and specific reference dates) with well-specified targets, taking into account tolerance levels that reflect the uncertainty of the metrics, and take action, where necessary, to rectify any deviations from these targets that exceed the tolerance levels. Separate targets and tolerances may be defined for initial development and ongoing performance. (b) Ensure that the tools used to assess risk differentiation are sound and adequate considering the available data. The risk differentiation is expected to be demonstrated on time series of realised default rates for grades or pools under different economic conditions."
Principles specific for grades and pools,,,,,
,,,,59,"A grade or pool is understood by the ECB as the subset of obligors or facilities to which the same PD is applied for the calculation of regulatory capital requirements, irrespective of how this PD has been assigned (e.g. through the use of masterscales)."
Distribution of obligors or facilities across grades or pools,,,,,
,,,,60,"Articles 170(1)(c) and (d) and 170(3)(b) and (c) of the CRR require, among other things, that the number of grades and pools is adequate to achieve meaningful risk differentiation and quantification of the PD at the grade or pool level. To comply with this requirement, institutions should: (a) justify the criteria applied when determining the number of grades or pools and the proportion of obligors or facilities assigned to each; (b) ensure that the concentration of numbers of obligors or facilities is not excessive in any grade or pool; any significant concentrations should be supported by convincing empirical evidence of the homogeneity of risk for those obligors or facilities; (c) ensure that no grade or pool has too few obligors or facilities, unless this is supported by convincing empirical evidence of the adequacy of the grouping of the exposures in question."
Homogeneity within grades,,,,,
,,,,61,"Articles 170(1)(b) and (d) and 170(3)(b) and (c) of the CRR require, among other things, that the structure of rating systems must ensure the homogeneity of obligors or facilities assigned to the same grade or pool. In accordance with this requirement and under paragraph 69 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD: (a) homogeneity is understood as obligors or facilities assigned to a grade having a reasonably similar default risk to ensure that the grade-level default rate is representative of all obligors or facilities in that grade; (b) in cases where it is found (through the use of additional drivers or a different discretisation of the existing ones) that a material subset of obligors or facilities within a grade/pool yields a significantly different default rate to that of the rest of the grade or pool, this is considered to indicate a lack of homogeneity."
Risk differentiation across grades or pools,,,,,
,,,,62,"To comply with the requirement to ensure adequate risk differentiation across grades or pools, institutions should ensure that there are no significant overlaps in the distribution of the default risk between grades or pools. This should be ensured through a meaningful differentiation of the default rates of each grade."
Principles specific for direct estimates,,,,,
,,,,63,See paragraph 90.
,,,4.1.3 Grade assignment dynamics,,
,,,,64,"In order to ensure a meaningful assessment of obligor characteristics, when assigning obligors or facilities to a grade or pool institutions should follow paragraphs 66 to 68 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. Although the time horizon used in PD estimation is one year, it is the ECB's understanding that the rating/grade/pool assignment process should also adequately anticipate and reflect risk over a longer time horizon and take into account plausible changes in economic conditions. In order to achieve this objective: (a) all relevant information should be included in the rating/grade/pool assignment process, giving an appropriate balance between drivers that are predictive only over a short time horizon and drivers that are predictive over a longer time horizon; (b) a horizon of two to three years is considered to be appropriate for most portfolios; (c) in accounting for plausible changes in economic conditions, the institution should consider at least past observed default patterns; (d) the model should perform under different economic conditions. As a consequence of the above, institutions' grade assignment dynamics should also adequately anticipate and reflect in the assignment of grades the risk over the longer time horizon. For clarity, this does not mean that grades remain stable over the longer time horizon in the event of changes in the risks that are specific to the obligor."
,,,,65,"Additionally, the following principles apply under the specific situations considered in (a) to (c) below:  (a) when using external scores or ratings (e.g. from an external bureau or external rating agency) as drivers for the purpose of risk differentiation within a specific model, institutions should identify the grade assignment dynamics embedded in the external rating and understand the effect on their own grade assignment dynamics, considering the other risk drivers used; (b) when using external ratings as target variables for the purpose of risk differentiation within a specific model (see Section 4.1.5), institutions should preserve their own grade assignment dynamics by taking the appropriate measures when necessary; (c) when mapping internal grades to external grades in order to use external default rates to estimate PD, institutions should ensure that the grade assignment dynamics of the external ratings are sufficiently similar to their own internal grade assignment dynamics, or perform the necessary adjustments during risk quantification to compensate for any differences."
,,,4.1.4 Use of ratings of third parties,,
,,,,66,"In accordance with Article 172(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions must assign each obligor to a grade or pool as part of the credit approval process. To comply with this requirement, institutions should have a clear policy specifying the conditions under which the rating of a third party which has a contractual or organisational relationship with an obligor of the institution (third-party support) may be taken into account in the risk assessment of that obligor. This policy should meet the following criteria. (a) It should specify in which situations the rating of a parent entity could be taken into account in the risk assessment of other entities of the group. In particular, the policy should specify those situations in which obligors are assigned to a better grade than their parent entities. (b) It should include provisions on the use of ratings of third parties that provide contractual support to more than one obligor. As a general rule, the policy should include, but not be limited to, possible prioritisation, eligibility, and the impact on the rating of the supporting third party."
,,,,67,"Articles 201 to 203 of the CRR establish requirements for the eligibility of unfunded credit protection. To comply with these requirements, institutions may recognise the guarantee by applying the risk weight of the guarantor under the standardised approach to the covered part of the exposure, provided that no own estimates of LGD and CCFs are used (foundation IRB (F-IRB)). This applies when an obligor is guaranteed by a third party that is not in the range of application of a PD model and the guarantee fulfils all requirements for credit risk mitigation (CRM), consistently with paragraph 44 of the EBA Report on the CRM Framework. In such situations, under paragraph 74 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, the guaranteed obligor should be included in the calculation of the one-year default rate of the grade the obligor is assigned to, before the recognition of the guarantee."
,,,,68,"In addition, when the institution reflects substitution effects arising from CRM in the ratings assigned to a material number of exposures within a rating system, there is a risk that the process of assigning exposures to grades or pools might not provide for a meaningful differentiation of risk, as a result of the inclusion of obligors with significantly different risk levels within the same rating grade. To mitigate this risk, institutions should verify that obligors guaranteed by a third party do not carry a significantly different level of risk from those in the same rating grade without such a guarantee, and that no separate calibration segment as referred to in paragraph 97 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD is required."
,,,,69,"When, under paragraph 62(a) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, an institution performs a rating transfer across different rating systems that do not share the same obligor rating scale, it should ensure that the mapping between rating scales is performed in such a way that the final PD estimate (including MoC) assigned to the guaranteed exposure amount is not better than the final PD estimate (including MoC) being transferred from a third party. Article 171(2) of the CRR establishes that information used to assign obligors and facilities to grades or pools must be current. To comply with this requirement, if a material proportion of exposures or obligors within a rating system receives a rating from another IRB rating system as a result of rating transfers, institutions should ensure that the transferred ratings are automatically updated when the rating of the third party changes or when the PDs of the rating system to which the third party belongs are re-estimated."
,,,,70,"In accordance with Article 179(1)(a) of the CRR, estimates must be plausible and intuitive and must be based on the material drivers of the respective risk parameters. To comply with this requirement, institutions should have sufficient empirical evidence to justify situations where an obligor has an equal or better PD estimate than the third party providing support as a consequence of the treatments specified in paragraph 62(c) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. In addition, differences between the various forms of contractual support should be considered in the PD models, unless there is sufficient empirical evidence that these differences are not relevant risk drivers. This understanding should also be taken into account if the rating of the third party is being considered as an indication for an override under paragraph 62(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD."
,,,,71,"In addition, in the situation described in paragraph 62(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, where a rating of a third party is being taken into account as an indication for an override of the assignment of the relevant obligor to a grade or pool, institutions should not assign a rating to an obligor that is better than the rating of the third party as a consequence of an override resulting solely from the existence of this third-party support."
,,,,72,"Furthermore, when third-party support is used extensively in the scope of application of a PD model, institutions should consider its existence as a potential relevant driver for risk differentiation, in accordance with Section 4.1.2."
,,,4.1.5 Use of shadow rating models,,
,,,,73,"The ECB understands a shadow rating model (SRM) to be an internal rating approach that selects and weighs the risk drivers to be used for risk differentiation purposes by identifying the main factors that explain external ratings provided by an external credit assessment institution or similar organisation, rather than internal directly observed defaults."
,,,,74,"In accordance with Article 144(1)(e) of the CRR, institutions must document the rationale for their rating systems. To comply with this requirement, institutions should justify and document the rationale for the use (and the continued use) of the SRM, instead of the internal default prediction model, and also document the alternative approaches that have been considered, in accordance with Article 41 of the Final Draft RTS on assessment methodology for IRB. In addition, and without prejudice to the risk differentiation requirements, when developing the model institutions should set explicit threshold criteria in terms of capacity to explain the target ratings and take appropriate action when those thresholds are not met."
,,,,75,"Assignment criteria and processes must be periodically reviewed to determine whether they remain appropriate for the current portfolio and external conditions. To comply with this requirement, as part of the review of estimates institutions should take all reasonable steps to demonstrate how the model performs on the application population in terms of predicting defaults or, if that is not possible (when there are not enough internal default data), at least in terms of predicting the target ratings."
,,,,76,"In accordance with Article 170(1)(b) of the CRR, institutions' rating systems must have an obligor rating scale which reflects exclusively the quantification of the risk of obligor default. To this end, institutions should adjust the ratings used as targets for their SRMs if they do not solely embed default risk. They should also document such adjustments."
,,,,77,"In accordance with Article 174(1)(a) of the CRR, when an institution uses a statistical model and other mechanical methods to assign exposures to obligors or facilities, the input variables must form a reasonable and effective basis for the resulting predictions. To comply with this requirement, when the institution uses an SRM external ratings should not be used as risk drivers in addition to target variables."
,,,,78,"When assigning obligors and facilities to grades or pools institutions must take all relevant information into account. To comply with this requirement, when different information sources are used institutions should ensure that they understand the impact of any differences between these sources and establish adequate procedures to ensure that these differences are adequately addressed."
,,,,79,"Furthermore, the data used to build the model must be representative of the population of the institution's actual obligors or exposures. To comply with this requirement, institutions should analyse and provide evidence of the representativeness of the data used for model development consistently with paragraphs 20 to 27 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD."
,,4.2 PD risk quantification,,,
,,,4.2.1 Relevant regulatory references,,
,,,,80,"In accordance with Article 180(1) of the CRR, for exposures to corporates, institutions, central governments and central banks and for equity exposures, institutions must estimate PDs by obligor grade from the LRA of one-year default rates. In accordance with Article 180(2) of the CRR, for retail exposures, institutions must estimate PDs by obligor/facility grade or pool from LRAs of one-year default rates. To comply with these requirements, institutions should follow Sections 4.2.2 to 4.2.6 below."
,,,4.2.2 Calculation of observed average default rates,,
,,,,81,"For the calculation of the one-year default rate and observed average default rates, institutions should follow paragraphs 73 to 81 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, also considering the following. (a) It is the understanding of the ECB that, for retail exposures and when the definition of default is applied at facility level, paragraphs 73 to 81 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD can be applied facility level. (b) Exposures for which there is no commitment (considering on-balance sheet exposures, off-balance sheet items and unadvised limits) at reference date should be excluded from the calculation of the default rate. Conversely, if there is an EAD estimate, then these exposures should be included in the calculation of the default rate."
,,,,82,"For the purpose of choosing an appropriate approach under paragraph 80 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, it is the ECB's understanding that overlapping one-year time windows should preferably be used when the analysis performed by the institution under paragraphs 80(a), 80(b) and/or 80(d) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD reveals any of the following: (a) the proportion of short-term and terminated contracts and/or the respective distribution of default rates is not stable over time; (b) the observed average default rate using overlapping one-year time windows is significantly different from the observed average default rate using non-overlapping one-year time windows; (c) there is a significant variation between the observed average default rates calculated using non-overlapping one-year time windows on different reference calculation dates within a year."
,,,,83,"Institutions should estimate PDs taking their own internal data into consideration. In cases where institutions use external or pooled data series to complement their internal data for the purpose of PD estimation, the more internal default experience an institution has, the less importance it needs to give to external data. In addition, institutions should ensure that these external or pooled data series are representative in accordance with Section 3.2 of this guide. To comply with the requirement for the data to be representative and as part of their representativeness analysis, institutions should also ensure that the average observed default rates from external data or from the external part of the pooled data are calculated separately from, and compared with, those based on internal data. This comparison should be made at the levels at which the default rate is to be calculated. This means, in accordance with paragraph 79 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, that the comparison should be made for each rating grade or pool and for the type of exposures covered by the relevant PD model, as well as for any relevant calibration segment. The direction and magnitude of the differences between these averages should be properly analysed and documented when calibrating the model, including the need and adequacy of the category A MoC considered with regard to paragraph 37(a)(viii) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, and duly followed up in the review of estimates."
,,,4.2.3 Calibration to the LRA default rate,,
,,,,84,"To calculate the LRA default rate, institutions should follow paragraphs 82 to 86 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. If an institution makes adjustments to the observed average default rates in order to obtain LRA default rates under paragraph 85(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, these adjustments should be based on (external) default rates, or - if no appropriate default rates are available - on other observed indicators relevant for the type of exposures considered."
,,,,85,"For the purpose of assessing the representativeness of the historical observation period used for the likely range of variability of one-year default rates under paragraph 83 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, the following should be taken into account. (a) Where the scarcity of internal exposures and/or defaults might unduly influence the variability of internally observed default rates (i.e. where the variability driven by statistical uncertainty is so high in comparison with the structural variability of default rates that it hampers any analysis of them), institutions should assess whether external or pooled default rate series can be used to identify the relevant historical observation period for the likely range of variability of one-year default rates. The external or pooled default series used should be relevant for the specific portfolio at least in terms of geographical composition, sectoral distribution and other relevant risk drivers. When no relevant default rate series can be identified, the items described in paragraphs 83(b) and 83(c) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD should play a crucial role in the assessment. (b) When taking into account the existence of one-year default rates relating to bad years as reflected in economic indicators that are relevant for the considered types of exposures within the historical observation period as referred to in paragraph 83(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, institutions should ensure that such indicators are relevant for the portfolio at least in the terms of geographical composition, sectoral distribution and other risk drivers relevant to the portfolio."
,,,,86,"With respect to calibration to the LRA default rate, institutions should follow paragraphs 87 to 99 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. If an institution chooses the approach referred to in paragraph 92(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, it should perform additional tests as part of the development and ongoing monitoring of its models to ensure that the final (post-calibration) PDs reflect the LRA default rate of each grade. Specifically, institutions should ensure that there are no systematic deviations when comparing the estimated PDs with the LRA default rate of the grades, i.e. the direction of divergences across grades should be random."
,,,4.2.4 Weighting for retail exposures,,
,,,,87,"Notwithstanding paragraph 84, for retail exposures institutions need not give equal importance to historical data if more recent data are a better predictor of loss rates. In the understanding of the ECB an institution may consider that the more recent data are a better predictor of loss rates and may give more importance to recent historical data if the following apply. (a) There is a significant improvement in the predictive power when using the more recent data with respect to the predictive power resulting from the use of an arithmetic average under paragraph 81 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. This improvement should be evidenced by comparing the estimated PDs for each grade with the realised default rates covering as long a period as possible, in accordance with Article 185(b) of the CRR. (b) Older data are considered as non-representative as a result of specific policy or business changes in the bank, but not in order to reflect current trends in default rates directly related to macroeconomic conditions. (c) The weighting approach is used in a consistent manner over time and any change in the applied weights of historical data is appropriately justified."
,,,4.2.5 PD quantification based on mapping to external grades,,
,,,,88,"The ECB interprets the possibility for institutions to attribute the default rate observed for the grades of a rating agency or similar organisation to its own grades in accordance with Article 180(1)(f) of the CRR as being equivalent to the use of external data for PD quantification at a more aggregated level (external grade) rather than at the obligor/facility level. Accordingly, Sections 3.2 and 4.2.2 of this chapter are relevant for institutions that do so."
,,,,89,"In accordance with Article 180(1)(f) of the CRR, mappings must be based on a comparison of internal rating criteria with the criteria used by the external organisation and on a comparison of the internal and external ratings of any common obligors. Biases or inconsistencies in the mapping approach or underlying data must be avoided. To comply with these requirements, institutions should follow the paragraphs listed below. 46 (a) Institutions should ensure that the quality of the mapping between internal and external rating scales at a given date and over time is consistent and provides for an adequate level of predictive ability. (b) When mapping internal grades to external grades, institutions should document and analyse any differences between the external and internal rating criteria. (c) The use of common obligors as a basis for the mapping should take into account their representativeness for the application portfolio. Article 180(2)(e) of the CRR. (d) Institutions should adjust the external rating scale if such rating scale does not solely embed default risk. They should also document such adjustments. (e) When mapping internal grades to external grades and using the default rates of the external grades provided by the organisation, if the latter has a material number of entities for which it no longer provides a rating (withdrawn rating), the institution should take this into account. It should adjust the external default rates accordingly, if necessary, and take into consideration the provisions of paragraph 75 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. In the event that an adjustment is performed, the institution should add the necessary MoC."
,,,4.2.6 Specific requirements for direct PD estimates,,
,,,,90,"In order to use direct PD estimates for the calculation of own funds requirements in accordance with Article 169(3) of the CRR, institutions should follow paragraphs 96 and 98(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. To assess whether the theoretical assumptions of the probability model underlying the estimation methodology are satisfied to a sufficient extent in practice under paragraph 96 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, institutions should do the following. 47 (a) Ensure good risk differentiation properties across the full PD range of the rating system. (b) Have an adequate and documented concept in place specifying the calibration function currently implemented (concrete functional form), including the underlying theoretical assumptions and the established processes to conduct the PD calibration. It is the ECB's understanding that institutions should ensure consistency between the score-inferred PDs and the observed default rates and should understand and justify the transformation of the scores into PD values. (c) Ensure that any transformation of the scores resulting from the probability model that is applied during the calibration does not change the ranking of the obligors/facilities (in other words, co-monotonicity between scores/raw PDs and PD values should be ensured). Moreover, institutions should avoid any undue influence of extreme values of score-inferred PDs on the shape of the calibration function. Additionally, and when institutions use different calibration functions for different sub-ranges, they should ensure that this mix is appropriate (both in terms of the functional forms used and the cut-offs selected) and that it is appropriately justified. In accordance with Article 170(1)(b) of the CRR, institutions' rating systems must have an obligor rating scale which reflects exclusively the quantification of the risk of obligor default. (d) Ensure that there is a relevant number of observations across the whole range of score-inferred PDs. Particular interest should be paid to situations where the probability model is extended to ranges of PD values where there are not enough defaulted observations. (e) Ensure that there are no excessive concentrations of exposures or obligors within the PD range of the rating system. In addition, high concentrations of observations in a specific range of score-inferred PDs should be properly analysed and justified in terms of homogeneity. (f) For the purpose of performing the additional tests at grade level referred to in paragraph 92(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, grades should be understood as sub-ranges of PD values. These sub-ranges should be defined in a way that: (i) represents sufficiently narrow ranges of PD values; (ii) contains a sufficient number of observations to ensure a meaningful calculation of the LRA default rate of the sub-range."
,,,,91,"In cases where institutions map the PDs to a masterscale (defined in terms of PD bounds) as a final step in the PD estimation process (using masterscale discrete PDs for the purpose of RWEA calculation), there is a risk that the mapping process could distort RWEAs. To mitigate this risk, institutions should verify that deviations between the masterscale PDs and the average of the direct PDs assigned to obligors in each grade do not show a systematic or material bias towards underestimation of PD per grade over time. This analysis should be provided for both the portfolio and for each grade."
,5 Loss given default,,,,
,,5.1 Realised LGD,,,
,,,5.1.1 Relevant regulatory references,,
,,,5.1.2 Reference dataset,,
,,,,92,"Under paragraph 102 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, institutions should estimate LGDs on the basis of their own loss or recovery experience. Institutions may supplement their own historical data on defaulted exposures with external data. The more own loss experience (i.e. the more internal defaults) an institution has, the less importance it needs to give to external data. Institutions should ensure that their own historical experience contains a minimum number of defaults in order to determine whether external data are sufficiently representative."
,,,,93,"To ensure that LGD estimations are accurate and are not underestimated as a result of different external and internal recovery processes, institutions should place greater importance on comparisons of internal recovery processes with the recovery processes underlying the external data, in cases where a high weight is assigned to external data. Where limited representativeness of external data is found, a category A MoC should be considered, in order to reflect the uncertainty of the estimation under paragraph 37(a)(viii). Its magnitude should also be quantified in relation to the weight assigned to the external data."
,,,,94,"When institutions use information derived from the market price of defaulted financial instruments to supplement their internal loss or recovery experience data, there is a risk of misspecification of their LGD estimates. To mitigate this risk, institutions should ensure the following: (a) institutions should verify whether the development sample is representative of the application portfolio at least in terms of regions and product type, even when those variables have not been identified as relevant risk drivers; (b) losses derived from market prices should be increased to reflect indirect costs, as specified in paragraph 146 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD."
,,,5.1.3 Calculation of realised LGD,,
,,,,95,"Article 4(1)(55) of the CRR defines LGD as the ratio of the loss on an exposure due to the default of a counterparty to the amount outstanding at default. For the purposes of Article 181(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions are required to calculate realised LGD. To comply with this requirement, it is the ECB's understanding that institutions should calculate realised LGD under paragraphs 100 to 103 and 131 to 146 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. In addition, when performing this calculation institutions should follow the observations in the succeeding paragraphs."
,,,,96,"In accordance with Article 181(1)(h) of the CRR, institutions must have estimates of LGD in-default and ELBE on defaulted exposures. To comply with this requirement, it is the ECB's understanding that all principles regarding the calculation of realised LGD should be applied for the estimation of LGD on nondefaulted exposures and for the estimation of LGD in-default and ELBE on defaulted exposures, unless mentioned otherwise (that is, if the reference date is considered instead of the date of default)."
,,,,97,"Where, in the case of retail exposures and purchased corporate receivables, institutions derive LGD estimates from realised losses and appropriate estimates of PDs in accordance with Articles 161(2) and 181(2)(a) of the CRR and under paragraph 103 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, all the principles regarding realised LGD should apply to realised losses."
,,,,98,"Institutions must document the specific definitions of default and loss used internally and ensure that they are consistent with the definitions set out in the CRR. To comply with these requirements, institutions should have in place sufficiently detailed policies and procedures to ensure that the realised LGD is calculated consistently and accurately, including the implementation of the definition of economic loss. These policies and procedures should include sufficiently detailed documentation to allow third parties to replicate the calculation of realised LGD. To ensure that the policies and procedures are implemented in an appropriate and adequate manner, the calculation process should be regularly reviewed by an independent unit."
,,,,99,"In accordance with Article 181(1)(a) of the CRR and under paragraph 100 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, institutions should calculate the realised LGD at facility level for each default. In exceptional cases, the ECB considers institutions to be compliant with the requirement to calculate realised LGD at facility level if they can prove that the recovery is not performed at individual facility level but at a more aggregated level (for example, several facilities of the same or different types secured by the same collateral). The realised LGD can therefore be calculated at a more aggregated level than individual facility level. For this exceptional deviation from the calculation of realised LGD at facility level to be acceptable, institutions should: 49 (a) provide evidence that recovery at aggregated level is legally enforceable. (b) on a regular basis (as often as review of estimates is performed or more often), provide evidence that recovery at a more aggregated level than single facility level is in practice enforced. This evidence should be based on the institution's historical practice and data and demonstrate that both the recovery process and its outcomes in terms of realised loss or recovery are the same for all the facilities considered at the aggregated level. Specifically, institutions should be able to prove that all collateral within an aggregation is called irrespective of the product triggering default (thus, for a current account as for a home loan) and that realised loss or observed recovery is the same for all types of facility within the aggregation. (c) for retail exposures where institutions use definition of default at facility level in accordance with the last sentence of Article 178(1) of the CRR, ensure that the default is triggered for all aggregated facilities. In addition, institutions following this approach should: (d) ensure that the parameters are applied in a manner that is consistent with how they have been estimated, i.e. across aggregated facilities; (e) ensure that the counting unit used for the purposes of risk quantification is at this aggregated level; (f) ensure that no bias results from the aggregation of facilities, by validating the estimates (PD, LGD, CCF) at the more aggregated level also."
,,,,100,"As mentioned in paragraph 95, for the purposes of Article 181(1)(a) of the CRR institutions are required to calculate realised LGD, which is defined by Article 4(1)(55) of the CRR as the ratio of the loss on an exposure due to the default of a counterparty to the amount outstanding at default. Furthermore, Article 5(2) of the CRR defines loss as an economic loss, including material discount effects, and material direct and indirect costs associated with collecting on the instrument. In accordance with these provisions, it is the ECB's understanding that institutions should calculate realised LGD as a ratio of the economic loss to the outstanding amount of the credit obligation at the moment of default, including any amount of principal, interest or fee (hereinafter outstanding amount at default). To calculate realised LGD, institutions should follow paragraphs 131 to 146 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. In addition, they should pay particular attention to the following points. (a) Outstanding amount at default includes any part of the exposure that has been forgiven or written off before or at the date of default (paragraph 134 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD). This amount is equal to the accounting value gross of credit risk adjustment (i.e. ""provisions"") (Article 166(1) of the CRR). This amount also includes interest and fees capitalised in the institution's income statement before the moment of default. However, interest and fees capitalised after the moment of default are not considered (paragraphs 137 to 138 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD). Where institutions include additional drawings after the moment of default to estimate CCFs, these additional drawings discounted to the moment of default are added to the outstanding amount at default in the denominator (paragraphs 139 to 142 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD). In other words, institutions should ensure that the exposure used for CCF estimation, where additional drawings after default are discounted with the same discount factor as applied for LGD, is consistent with the denominator of the LGD. (b) Economic loss is calculated under paragraph 132 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. This also applies in the specific case of facilities that return to non-defaulted status, where losses arising from payment delays are expected to be accounted for as well as the ""artificial cash flow"" envisaged by paragraph 135 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. (c) When recoveries are not directly observed but calculated on the basis of the difference between exposure values at two consecutive dates or derived, even partially, from some other treatment, all assumptions should be duly justified and clearly documented in order to adequately replicate the recovery flows that occur during the recovery process in accordance with letters a) and b) above. Institutions are expected to pay particular attention to the treatment of interest and fees capitalised after default, the treatment of additional drawings and the treatment of write-offs."
,,,,101,"The economic loss as defined in Article 5(2) of the CRR also includes material discounts. The understanding of the ECB is as follows. (a) Paragraph 134 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD refers to all losses incurred through forgiveness or write-off. (b) Where institutions open new facilities to replace previously defaulted facilities as part of restructuring or for technical reasons, the economic loss should include the decrease in the degree of financial obligation arising from changes in the contractual conditions (i.e. material forgiveness or postponement of payment of principal, interest, or fees). The amount by which the financial obligation has diminished should be calculated under paragraph 51 of the EBA Guidelines on the definition of default. However, no double-counting of debt forgiveness is intended (for example, in the case of exposures that return to non-defaulted status, a possible doublecounting through the diminished financial obligation and the artificial cash flow is not intended)."
,,,,102,"Realised LGD for individual facilities may be zero or lower when it is the actual result of the recovery process (for example, where additional recoveries offset the discounting effect and costs). Institutions should, however, pay particular attention to no-loss exposures, since they may reveal issues with the calculation of realised losses - for example, costs not being adequately allocated to recovery processes, or inadequate treatment of amounts forgiven or written off."
,,,5.1.4 Treatment of multiple defaults,,
,,,,103,"For the purpose of LGD estimation and in order to ensure an appropriate measurement of economic loss as defined in Article 5(2) of the CRR, institutions should consider an exposure that returns to normal status and subsequently defaults in a short period of time as being constantly defaulted from the moment the first default occurred. This treatment should be applied under paragraph 101 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. In addition, institutions should follow the observations in the following paragraphs. (a) Paragraph 101 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD envisages the definition of a period longer than nine months when this is appropriate for the specific type of exposures and reflects the economic meaning of the default experience. It is the ECB's understanding that a longer period is adequate when the proportion of subsequent defaults occurring on individual facilities over a period of more than nine months is significant, unless institutions are able to provide evidence that the second (or subsequent) default is unconnected with the original default event. This evidence may include analysis of the curing process. (b) Time considered between two defaults is conditional upon the existence and length of probation periods. Where institutions have not adopted the minimum three-month probation period, or any equivalent or longer probation period, on non-distressed restructured facilities under paragraph 71 of the EBA Guidelines on the definition of default, they should consider a 12-month period for the application of paragraph 101 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. Where they have not adopted the minimum 12-month probation period, or any equivalent or longer probation period, on distressed restructured facilities under paragraph 72 of the EBA Guidelines on the definition of default, they should consider a 21-month period for the application of paragraph 101 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. (c) In the particular case of an institution opening new facilities to replace previously defaulted facilities as part of restructuring or for technical reasons, it should be able to make or trace a connection between the restructured facility and the facility (or facilities) previously advanced and which it is restructuring."
,,5.2 LGD structure,,,
,,,5.2.1 Relevant regulatory references,,
,,,,104,"In order to comply with the requirements regarding the structure of LGD models as set out in Article 170(1)(e) and (f) and 170(3)(b) and (c) of the CRR, institutions should follow the observations below."
,,,,105,"LGD estimates must be based on the material drivers of risk. To comply with this requirement, institutions should identify and analyse potential risk drivers under paragraphs 121 to 123 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. When selecting the risk drivers, institutions should take into consideration any changes in product mix or characteristics between the reference and default dates."
,,,,106,"Institutions' rating systems must provide for a meaningful assessment of obligor and transaction characteristics, a meaningful differentiation of risk and accurate and consistent quantitative estimates of risk. It is the ECB's understanding that to comply with this requirement institutions should demonstrate that, in terms of the range of application of LGD models, the model performs adequately (in terms of discriminatory power and predictive power) on economically significant and material sub-ranges of application of the rating systems. The sub-ranges are identified by splitting the full range of application of the LGD model into different parts on the basis of potential drivers for risk differentiation, among which, where relevant, the drivers referred to in paragraph 121 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD."
,,,,107,"The number of grades and pools must be adequate for a meaningful risk differentiation and for the quantification of the LGD at the grade or pool level. To comply with this requirement, institutions should ensure the following (a) an adequate distribution of facilities across grades or pools in the datasets used for development and (initial and regular) validation. For this purpose: (i) any unusually low number of facilities in a grade or pool is expected to be supported by empirical evidence of the adequacy of isolating those facilities in a specific grade or pool; (ii) any unusually high concentration of facilities in a grade or pool is expected to be supported by empirical evidence of homogeneity within these grades or pools (for example by analysing whether some potential risk drivers (e.g. exposure size) that could further differentiate between riskier and less risky facilities have not been considered). (b) sufficient homogeneity of the risk within each grade or pool by providing empirical evidence that the grade-level LGD is adequate for all facilities in that grade. For this purpose, in cases where it is found (through the use of additional drivers or a different discretisation of the existing ones) that a material subset of facilities within a grade or pool yields a significantly different average realised LGD to that of the rest of the grade or pool, this is considered to indicate a lack of homogeneity. (c) sufficient heterogeneity of the risk across grades or pools by providing empirical evidence that the average realised LGD is different across consecutive grades or pools, for subsets for which there is a meaningful order."
,,,,108,"Where an institution uses direct estimates of risk parameters, these may be seen as estimates assigned to grades on a continuous rating scale. In this case, in the ECB's understanding the same requirements apply when an institution uses direct estimates of risk parameters as apply to grade-based models. To comply with these requirements, institutions are expected to ensure risk differentiation in accordance with the following principles: (a) if the LGD estimates used to calculate the RWEAs are based on default weighted LRAs of realised LGDs for grades or pools, irrespective of whether at some point direct LGD estimates may have been used to define such grades or pools, this grade or pool level is the relevant one for the application of the principles set out in paragraph 107; (b) when the situation described in point (a) above does not apply and, instead, several components are estimated separately and then combined in order to obtain the direct LGD estimates at facility level, institutions should adequately analyse and reflect in the model possible dependencies between the components (e.g. through relevant risk drivers); (c) in the case of other direct LGD estimates (i.e. where no components are defined) the principles above are expected to be applied where relevant."
,,,,109,"In addition to paragraph 108 above and when institutions split the facilities into different components (for example secured and unsecured), there is a risk that a meaningful differentiation of risk will not be achieved at facility level. To mitigate this risk, institutions should ensure that no bias is introduced in the risk differentiation when combining the different components in order to obtain the final LGD estimate at facility level. Specifically: (a) the allocation of recovery flows to these components should be adequately documented and implemented in a consistent way; (b) risk differentiation (analogous to risk quantification) should be ensured with respect to facility level."
,,5.3 Risk quantification,,,
,,,5.3.1 Relevant regulatory references,,
,,,5.3.2 Observed average LGD,,
,,,,110,"To comply with the requirement of obtaining an LRA LGD in accordance with Article 181(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions should calculate the observed average LGD under paragraphs 147, 148, 154-157 and 160 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. When performing this calculation, institutions should follow the principles set out below."
,,,,111,"Under paragraph 147 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, default observations that are triggered close to the time of the LGD estimation process (i.e. observations with a recent default when the LGD is being estimated) are part of the historical observation period and should be included in the RDS. Since for these recent defaults only limited information is available regarding the full recovery process, the treatment of incomplete recovery processes envisaged in paragraph 158 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD is more complex and could add uncertainty to the LGD estimates. It is the ECB's understanding that to mitigate this risk institutions may establish a minimum period of time during which the default should be observed in order for it to be considered in the calculation of the observed average LGD. This minimum period should be adequately justified and institutions should ensure that all relevant information regarding defaults observed for a shorter period (e.g. a change in the characteristics of defaults) is considered in the LGD estimates. In any case this period should not be longer than 12 months."
,,,,112,"For the purposes of LGD estimation (and validation), long recovery processes are expected to be considered as closed under paragraph 156 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. The objective of defining the maximum period of the recovery process (""time-to-workout"") is to avoid situations where institutions give consideration to overly optimistic recoveries from open exposures that are already at a very advanced stage of the recovery process. To achieve this, the specification of the ""time-to-workout"" should be supported by evidence of the observed pace of recoveries and be consistent with the nature of the products concerned, the type of exposures and the operational recovery process. In addition, the institution should substantiate and clearly document the studies that support the formulation of the time-to-workout and should pay particular attention to the following. (a) The specific moment after the date of default at which nearly nil evolution of the average cumulative recovery rates is observed. For example, when the cumulative recovery curves show a pronounced increase after which they flatten out, the time spent in default after the significant increase occurs could be used directly as the time-to-workout, especially in the case of unsecured exposures. (b) The period of time after the date of default where the cumulative percentage of closed/recovered exposures flattens. (c) The number of exposures used to construct the curves referred to at letters (a) and (b) above, in order to identify situations where only a few cases contribute to the shape of the curves. (d) The expected recovery rate conditioned to vintages higher than the timeto-workout. (e) For secured exposures, the share of exposures for which recoveries from collateral have not yet been realised."
,,,5.3.3 Treatment of incomplete recovery processes,,
,,,,113,"In order to obtain an LRA LGD in accordance with Article 181(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions should ensure that the relevant information from incomplete recovery processes is taken into account in a conservative manner. For this purpose, institutions should analyse their incomplete recovery processes and extract the information relevant for LGD estimation under paragraphs 153 to 159 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. In addition, institutions should:  (a) justify and document their methodology for the treatment of incomplete recovery processes, and in particular how they take into account paragraph 159 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD; (b) for the purpose of paragraph 159(a) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD in particular, base the extrapolation of future recoveries on defaults arising from vintages (i.e. group of exposures which defaulted in a given period of time) for which, during the period already observed, similar average past recoveries have been realised on similar exposures; (c) in order to ensure transparency regarding the impact from the treatment of incomplete recovery processes, assess the sensitivity of the treatment with respect to the main assumptions."
,,,5.3.4 Recovery processes where collateral has been repossessed and not yet sold,,
,,,,114,"In specific cases where institutions have taken possession of but not yet sold the collateral, there is a risk that the value of repossession might not adequately reflect the value of the repossessed collateral. To mitigate this risk, institutions should estimate haircuts to the value of the collateral under paragraphs 116 to 118 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. In order to ensure transparency regarding the impact from the treatment of repossessed collateral, institutions should: (a) compare the estimated haircuts with the available observations regarding the repossession and subsequent sale of similar types of collateral; (b) assess the impact on the LRA LGD of the inclusion of the repossessed collateral by performing sensitivity analyses based on the application of different haircuts to the value of the collateral (at least, by applying a haircut of 100% to cases where collateral has been repossessed but not yet sold)."
,,,5.3.5 Long-run average,,
,,,,115,"To comply with the requirement of obtaining an LRA LGD by facility grade or pool in accordance with Article 181(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions should estimate LGDs under paragraphs 100 and 149 to 164 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. When performing this estimation, institutions should follow the observations below."
,,,,116,"Under paragraph 150 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, institutions should calculate the LRA LGD as an arithmetic average of realised LGDs over a historical observation period weighted by a number of defaults. When performing this calculation, institutions should observe the following points. (a) In the event of definition of default applied at obligor level, where two facilities of the same obligor are assigned to the same facility grade or pool, institutions are expected to calculate the average realised LGD as follows: first take the exposure-weighted average realised LGD at the obligor level and then take the arithmetic average LGD weighted by the number of defaulted obligors within the LGD grade. If institutions use a different approach, they should demonstrate that there are no systematic deviations from the approach referred to above. (b) Under paragraph 160 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, the realised LGD of each observation should be floored at zero for the purpose of LGD estimation. In cases where LGD estimates for specific facility grades or pools are low or even zero (in exceptional cases), in order to ensure that these estimates are accurate and not driven by (systematic) errors or distortions institutions should ensure that their estimation process is accurate. In particular, they should ensure that there is a sufficient number of observations supporting the estimate and that these outcomes are carefully monitored and scrutinised. (c) Under paragraph 162 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, institutions should apply an appropriate treatment to extremely high values of realised LGDs much above 100%, at the level of data quality, risk drivers, assignment to grades or pools or assignment to calibration segments. To ensure that the estimates are accurate, institutions are not expected to cap realised LGD values (i.e. to replace the observed value by a pre-defined value when the observed value is above the pre-defined one)."
,,,,117,"Institutions can calibrate LGD estimates to the LRA LGD calculated at the level of the calibration segment under paragraph 161(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. When calibration segments are used for the purpose of LGD estimations, institutions are expected to base their decision on a sound rationale, in particular on quantitative evidence. It is the ECB's understanding that, to comply with Article 181(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions should also calculate the LRA LGD at a more granular level than the calibration segment (i.e. individual LGD grades or pools if estimation is discrete or ranges of LGD values if the estimation is continuous). The level should be appropriate for the application of the model. In addition, institutions should ensure that there are no systematic deviations when comparing the estimated LGDs with the LRA of realised LGDs at this more granular level, i.e. the direction of divergences should be random."
,,,,118,"Where the LGD is the result of a combination of different components (for example, secured and unsecured components), the calibration step according to paragraph 117 (ensuring that the average realised LGD and the average estimated LGD across facilities within the same calibration segment/range of LGD values are aligned) is expected to be performed after the aggregation of the components. In addition, there is a risk that systematic deviations could be introduced to the estimation when combining these different components. In this case, the direction of divergences would not be random. To mitigate this risk, institutions should do the following. (a) For defaults in the RDS which are closed or considered closed, compare the realised LGD at facility level with the estimates of LGD. Separate tests should be performed for the LGD applied to the performing portfolio and the LGD in-default. Analogous tests should be performed at component level. (b) In the case of models based on components with underlying data covering time windows with different lengths and/or periods for each of the components, ensure that no bias is introduced in the LGD estimates at facility level with respect to the LRA. The analysis referred to in point (a) should be performed, at least, for the available common time period."
,,,,119,"Notwithstanding paragraph 116, for retail exposures institutions need not give equal importance to historical data if more recent data are a better predictor of loss rates. It is the ECB's understanding that an institution may consider the more recent data to be a better predictor of loss rates and may give more importance to recent historical data if its methodology is in line with paragraphs 150 to 152 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD and if the following apply. (a) There is a significant improvement in predictive power when using the more recent data with respect to the predictive power resulting from the use of an arithmetic average under paragraph 150 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. This improvement would be evidenced by comparing the estimated LGDs for each grade with the average realised LGD covering as long a period as possible in accordance with Article 185(b) of the CRR. (b) The oldest data are considered as non-representative as a result of specific policy or business changes in the bank, but not in order to reflect current trends in loss rates directly related to macroeconomic conditions. (c) The weighting approach is used in a consistent manner over time and any change in the applied weights of historical data is appropriately justified."
,,,,120,"In accordance with Article 179(1)(a) of the CRR, an institution's own estimates must incorporate all relevant data and must be derived using both historical experience and empirical evidence. To comply with these requirements, when institutions use external or pooled data to complement their own loss or recovery experience, they should ensure that LRA LGDs derived from external or pooled data are also calculated separately from those based on internal data. In addition, the direction and magnitude of the differences between these averages should be properly analysed and documented when calibrating the model, including the adequacy of the MoC considered, and duly followed up in the review of estimates."
,,,,121,"Article 179(1)(d) of the CRR requires, among other things, that the population of exposures represented in the data used for estimation, the lending standards used when the data were generated and other relevant characteristics must be comparable with those of the institution's exposures and standards. Paragraph 164 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD further specifies that institutions should take into account not only the current characteristics of the portfolio but also, where relevant, any changes to the structure of the portfolio that are expected to happen in the foreseeable future. When institutions perform adjustments to their LGD estimates in order to comply with these requirements, it is the ECB's understanding that the following principles should apply. (a) The adjustment should be based on a comparison of the data used in risk quantification with the institution's application portfolio. In many circumstances (for example where a type of product has been discontinued by the institution), the addition of these characteristics as risk drivers for LGD estimation is the most simple and effective way of dealing with issues of non-representativeness. (b) In the event of changes in lending or recovery policies, institutions should make only conservative adjustments until they are able to provide empirical evidence concerning the impact of the new policies. Such evidence should be based on the inclusion in the RDS of data from periods more recent than the change of policy. (c) All economic and market conditions experienced in the past and reflected in historical observations should be considered by institutions as part of foreseeable economic and market conditions (paragraph 147 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD). They are not, therefore, a reason to perform adjustments."
,,,5.3.6 Downturn LGD,,
,,,,122,"To obtain LGD estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn in accordance with Article 181(1)(b) of the CRR, institutions are expected to: (a) characterise an economic downturn in accordance with the Final Draft RTS on the specification of the nature, severity and duration of an economic downturn; (b) derive LGD estimates which are appropriate for the downturn conditions specified, in accordance with the EBA Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (""Downturn LGD estimation"")."
,,5.4 Estimation of ELBE and LGD in-default,,,
,,,5.4.1 Relevant regulatory references,,
,,,,123,"In accordance with Article 181(1)(h) of the CRR, for the specific case of exposures already in default institutions must use the sum of their ELBE for each exposure, given current economic circumstances and exposure status and their estimate of the increased loss rate caused by possible additional unexpected losses during the recovery period. To comply with these requirements, institutions should estimate ELBE and LGD in-default under paragraphs 165 to 193 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. In this process, institutions should follow the observations below."
,,,,124,"In accordance with Article 181(1)(h) of the CRR, the ELBE must represent the best estimate of expected loss given current economic circumstances and exposure status. To comply with this requirement, it is the ECB's understanding that institutions should take into consideration the economic conditions expected over the period of the recovery process, and in particular reflect downturn conditions in the ELBE, if and only if current economic conditions are in a downturn or a downturn is expected over the period of the recovery process. This can be done either by adding the relevant macroeconomic and economic factors as drivers of the ELBE model under paragraph 183 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, or alternatively through an adjustment to the LRA as referred to in paragraph 184 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD."
,,,,125,"Under paragraph 193 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, LGD in-default can be estimated directly or as the sum of ELBE and an add-on capturing the unexpected loss related to the exposures in default that may occur during the recovery period. In particular, the following should be taken into consideration. (a) The use of a constant value for unexpected losses for all defaulted exposures is not risk sensitive. In the ECB's understanding, therefore, it does not allow an accurate assessment of risk. Where an institution does use a constant value, it should justify this. It should demonstrate that the constant value in question is an adequate estimate of all the components of unexpected loss envisaged in paragraph 193(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD during the remaining recovery period, i.e. between the date for which estimates are being applied and the final closure of the recovery process. This analysis should be performed at least for every calibration segment. (b) LGD in-default estimates are generally expected to be higher than ELBE estimates and only equal for duly justified individual exposures, which are expected to be very limited."
,6 Conversion factors,,,,
,,"6.1 Commitments, unadvised limits and scope of application",,,
,,,6.1.1 Relevant regulatory references,,
,,,,126,"In accordance with Article 151(7) and (8) of the CRR, institutions must use own estimates of CCFs for the retail exposure class. If they have received permission to use own estimates for the corporate, institutional, central government and central bank exposure classes, they must again use own estimates of CCFs, instead of the conversion factors set out in in Article 166(8)(a) to (d) of the CRR. In both cases (retail and non-retail exposure classes), the scope of CCF modelling is, in the ECB's understanding, limited to the off-balance sheet items referred to in Article 166(8) of the CRR. The treatment of off-balance-sheet items other than those mentioned in Article 166(1) to (8) of the CRR is specified in Article 166(10). In accordance with Article 166(10) of the CRR, an exposure value must be a specific percentage of an off-balance-sheet item's value, based on the classification of off-balance-sheet items established in Annex I of the CRR."
,,,,127,"Conversion factor means the ratio of the currently undrawn amount of a commitment that could be drawn and that would therefore be outstanding at default to the currently undrawn amount of the commitment. The extent of the commitment is determined by the advised limit, unless the unadvised limit is higher. The exposure value for the items listed in Article 166(8) of the CRR must be calculated as the committed but undrawn amount multiplied by a CCF. To calculate the exposure value as required by Article 166(8) of the CRR, institutions should adopt the following approach. (a) Treat a facility as an exposure from the earliest date at which the facility is recorded in the institution's systems in a way that would allow the obligor to make a drawing. An unadvised limit is any credit limit defined by the institution (i) that is above the limit the obligor has been informed of by the institution; and (ii) according to which additional drawings are possible, at least temporarily. This higher (unadvised) credit limit may be disregarded if its availability is subject to a further credit assessment by the institution, as long as this additional assessment includes a re-rating or a confirmation of the rating of the obligor. (b) Consider as ""commitment"" any contractual arrangement that has been offered by the institution and accepted by the obligor to extend credit, purchase assets or issue credit substitutes. (c) Consider as ""conditionally cancellable commitment"" any such arrangement that can be and will be cancelled by the institution if the obligor fails to meet conditions set out in the facility documentation, including conditions that must be met by the obligor prior to any initial or subsequent drawdown under the arrangement. (d) Consider as ""credit lines"" all lines including products such as facilities granted for construction where the payments to the obligor are made according to the progress of the construction. Products such as guarantees are not, however, included in the concept of credit lines."
,,,,128,"For institutions not using own estimates of CCFs for exposures to corporates, institutions, central governments and central banks, Article 166(8) of the CRR defines the CCFs to be used for the purpose of calculating RWEA. In accordance with Article 166(8)(a) and (c) of the CRR, institutions not using their own estimates of CCFs for non-retail exposures are permitted to apply a 0% CCF, under certain conditions. It is the ECB's understanding that, to comply with the conditions established under Article 166(8)(a) and (c) of the CRR and to apply a 0% CCF, institutions should have in place internal control systems that allow them to monitor the obligor's financial condition and to act in the event that a deterioration in the obligor's credit quality is detected. They should also be able to provide evidence that the internal control systems work effectively. For this purpose, institutions should demonstrate that there is only a very limited number of exposures of a particular type observed during the previous year for which the EAD is higher than the drawn amount at the reference date. This analysis should be performed on a regular basis. The ECB considers it good practice when institutions perform this analysis on an annual basis."
,,6.2 Realised CCFs,,,
,,,6.2.1 Relevant regulatory references,,
,,,,129,"To ensure that a consistent and accurate approach is adopted to calculate the realised CCFs, institutions should have in place sufficiently detailed policies and procedures. For institutions to comply with the data-related requirements set out in Article 176(4) of the CRR, their RDS: (a) should not be capped at the principal amount outstanding or at facility limits; (b) should include all credit obligations (paragraph 16 of the EBA Guidelines on the definition of default), especially accrued interest, other due payments (e.g. fees) and limit excesses."
,,,,130,"In accordance with Article 182(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions must calculate the realised CCF at facility level for each default. In cases where realised LGD is calculated at a more aggregated level than single facility level, as described in paragraph 99 above, CCF estimation can be performed at facility level or at the LGD aggregation level. One such example is where CCF is estimated by facility while several facilities are aggregated for LGD purposes, since they are all secured by the same collateral. In this case, institutions should: (a) for retail exposures where they use the definition of default at facility level in accordance with the last paragraph of Article 178(1) of the CRR, apply full contagion of default across aggregated facilities; (b) ensure consistency between estimation and application of the parameters; (c) ensure that no bias results from the aggregation of facilities by validation of the estimates (PD, LGD, CCF) also at the more aggregated level."
,,,,131,"For the purposes of Article 182(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions must compute realised CCF. To comply with this requirement, in the understanding of the ECB institutions should adopt the following approach. (a) Calculate realised CCF as the ratio of the difference between the EAD and the exposure at the reference date in the numerator, and the difference between the limit at reference date and the exposure at reference date (i.e. the amount available to be drawn at the reference date) in the denominator. This does not mean that, to address the issues with the ""region of instability"", institutions may not use direct EAD realisation (as referred to in paragraph 137(a) of this chapter). (b) Ensure that the definition of exposure is identical to the one used for LGD estimation. In particular, treatment of post-default drawings should be identical for the exposures used in both the LGD and CCF estimations. Discounted additional drawings are expected to be included in CCF when they are included in the LGD denominator. See also paragraph 100(a) above. (c) For each reference date and in cases where the same facility defaults more than once during the observation period, consider as the date of default relevant for CCF purposes the date of the first default."
,,6.3 CCF structure,,,
,,,6.3.1 Relevant regulatory references,,
,,,,132,"To comply with the requirements for the structure of the CCF models established in Article 170 of the CRR, and particularly when considering the risk drivers envisaged by paragraph (4) of that Article, institutions should follow these principles: (a) Demonstrate a detailed understanding of the impact on the CCF model of changes in customer product mix or characteristics that take place between reference and default dates and the materiality of that impact. If the impact is material, institutions should address it within their own estimation process. This is because changes in exposure characteristics (e.g. a change in the value of the limit) or ""product profile transformations"" (e.g. a revolving loan that has been converted into a term loan or vice versa) which commonly occur between reference and default dates can impact the CCF model. (b) Although the reference date for the calculation of realised CCF should be up to 12 months prior to default, institutions should analyse risk drivers considering information not only at the reference date but also before that date whenever relevant. In assessing whether the use of information from before the reference date is relevant, institutions should take into account the volatility of the risk driver over time. (c) Ensure that the models reflect the institution's current policies and strategies regarding account monitoring, including limit monitoring, and payment processing."
,,6.4 CCF risk quantification,,,
,,,6.4.1 Relevant regulatory references,,
,,,,133,"The exposure value for undrawn commitments is calculated as the committed but undrawn amount multiplied by a CCF. CCFs can also be derived from direct estimates (for example by modelling total facility EAD) in accordance with Article 169(3) of the CRR. In this case, and in order to comply with Article 182(1)(a) of the CRR, it is the ECB's understanding that institutions should also calculate the LRA CCF at a level more granular than calibration segment that is appropriate for the application of the model, namely using individual CCF values if estimation is discrete or sub-ranges of CCF values if estimation is continuous. In addition, institutions should ensure that there are no systematic deviations when comparing the estimated CCFs with the LRA realised CCFs in sub-ranges. In other words, the direction of divergences should be random."
,,,,134,"In accordance with Article 182(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions are required to calculate the default weighted LRA CCF separately for each facility grade or pool. To comply with this requirement, institutions should adopt the following approach. 59 (a) Ensure that the historical observation period is as broad as possible and contains data from different periods characterised by different economic circumstances, including bad years as reflected in economic indicators that are relevant for the type of exposures considered. (b) Calculate the observed average CCF for each facility grade or pool on all defaults observed in the historical observation period. Institutions should apply an appropriate treatment to extremely high values of realised CCF much above 100%, at the level of data quality, risk drivers, assignment to grades or pools or assignment to calibration segments. To ensure that the estimates are accurate, it is the ECB's understanding that institutions are not expected to cap realised CCF values. In other words, they are not expected to replace the observed value by a pre-defined value when the observed value is above the pre-defined one. (c) When the historical observation period is considered to be representative of the LRA, the average realised CCFs should be computed as the arithmetic average of the yearly averages of realised CCFs in that period. (d) When the historical observation period is not considered to be representative of the LRA: (e) (i) if bad years are under-represented in the historical observation period, the observed average CCF should be adjusted upwards in order to estimate an LRA CCF; (ii) if bad years are over-represented in the historical observation period, the observed average CCF may be adjusted to estimate an LRA CCF where there is a significant correlation between the economic indicators referred to in paragraph 122(a) and the available observed CCF. It is the ECB's understanding that, where CCF estimates for specific facility grades or pools are low or even zero (in exceptional cases) before the MoC is applied, and in order to ensure that these estimates are accurate and not driven by (systematic) errors or distortions, institutions should ensure that their estimation process is pertinent and accurate. In particular, they should ensure that, in these specific facility grades or pools, there is only a very limited number of exposures for which the exposure at the moment of default is higher than the drawn amount at the reference date, and that these outcomes are carefully monitored and scrutinised."
,,,,135,"Notwithstanding paragraph 134, for retail exposures an institution need not give equal importance to historical data if more recent data are a better predictor of drawdowns. In the ECB's understanding, an institution may consider that the more recent data are a better predictor of drawdowns and may give more importance to recent historical data if the following apply. (a) There is a significant improvement in predictive power when using the more recent data compared with the predictive power resulting from the use of an arithmetic average. This improvement can be evidenced by comparing the estimated CCFs for each grade with the average realised CCF covering as long a period as possible, as set out in Article 185(b) of the CRR. (b) The oldest data are considered as non-representative as a result of specific policy or business changes in the bank, but not in order to reflect current trends in realised CCFs directly related to macroeconomic conditions. (c) The weighting approach is used in a consistent manner over time and any change in the applied weights of historical data is appropriately justified."
,,,,136,"To comply with the requirements of Article 182(1)(b) and to have CCF estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn, institutions should characterise an economic downturn in accordance with the Final Draft RTS on the specification of the nature, severity and duration of an economic downturn. To this end, an impact assessment should be performed to identify which identified downturn period is most strongly evidenced by elevated levels of realised CCFs. Any lag between the downturn period and the date of the impact on the realised CCFs should be taken into account. This means that where high levels of realised CCFs are not experienced simultaneously with the downturn periods, but nevertheless result from it, these high CCFs should be considered as the CCFs appropriate for the economic downturn."
,,,,137,"In order to ensure a meaningful assessment of transaction characteristics, as required by Article 144(1)(a) of the CRR, particular attention should be given to the following observations. (a) A common issue in estimating CCFs concerns facilities close to being fully drawn at the relevant reference date, as a result of the instability that may be observed in the estimates (also known as ""region of instability""). To mitigate this risk, institutions should ensure that their CCF model is robust and provides estimates that are effectively protected against undesirable issues caused by the ""region of instability"" and/or that their estimates are adjusted adequately. (b) Article 182 of the CRR lays down the requirements for CCF estimates. In cases where institutions apply a fixed yet conservatively specified CCF (e.g. 100%), the ECB considers them to be compliant with the requirements when these estimates are applied in specific circumstances, such as scarcity of data and low materiality of the scope of application, for example in the event that the facility has no on-balance exposure until the first disbursement and estimates are monitored and validated."
,7 Model-related MoC,,,,
,,7.1 Relevant regulatory references,,,
,,,,138,"Institutions must add to their estimates an MoC that is related to the expected range of estimation errors. To comply with this requirement, institutions are expected to follow paragraphs 36 to 52 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD."
,,,,139,"Since the MoC requirements laid down by the CRR also apply in cases where institutions estimate CCFs, paragraph 138 is also relevant in such cases."
,,,,140,"In the understanding of the ECB, to reflect the dispersion of the statistical estimators as set out in paragraph 43(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD, institutions should adopt the following approach. (a) For PD, estimate an MoC to account for statistical uncertainty/sampling error affecting the LRA estimate at grade/pool level. This MoC should be based on the distribution of the estimator, which is the average of one-year default rates of the grade/pool across time (i.e. the distribution of (sum DR t )/T, considering that the uncertainty is primarily driven by the statistical uncertainty of each one-year default rate and the length of the time series. As a result, it is expected that the lower the number of observations per grade and the shorter the time series are, the higher the MoC of the grade should be. Institutions need to be aware of and deal adequately with the dependency between default rates over time on the quantification of the MoC, e.g. when using overlapping windows for the calculation of default rates. The above principles also apply for institutions using direct PD estimates and for institutions calibrating the LRA default rate at the level of the calibration segment, as referred to in paragraph 92(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. When using direct PD estimates, the MoC is based on the distribution of this direct PD estimator (which includes the risk differentiation function), implicitly reflecting the uncertainty of the LRA. When calibration is performed at calibration segment level, the general estimation error may be computed at that level when the statistical uncertainty/sampling error is not significantly different across grades or PD sub-ranges. (b) Similarly, for LGD and CCF, estimate an MoC to account for statistical uncertainty/sampling error affecting the final estimates. This MoC should be defined on the basis of the distribution of the estimators, considering that their uncertainty is primarily driven by the statistical uncertainty of the observations used to compute the long-run and downturn estimates and the length of the time series."
,8 Review of estimates,,,,
,,8.1 Relevant regulatory references,,,
,,,,141,"Institutions must review their estimates whenever new information comes to light but at least on an annual basis. To comply with this requirement, they are expected to have in place a framework under paragraphs 217 to 221 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD."
,,,,142,"Since the review of estimates requirements under the CRR also apply in cases where an institution estimates CCFs, paragraph 141 is also relevant to such cases."
,,,,143,"In the ECB's understanding and for the purposes of paragraph 141, the following principles apply. (a) For PD models and regarding the analysis of the predictive power envisaged by paragraph 218(c) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD: (i) the analysis should be performed at grade level; for institutions using direct PD estimates, it should be performed at a sufficient level of granularity; (ii) institutions should use a range of metrics to assess predictive ability, including statistical tests and graphical analysis of the evolution of default rates and PD. (b) The analysis referred to in paragraph 218(c)(i) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD should also consider, for CCFs, whether including the most recent data leads to a significant change in the LRA CCF or downturn CCF. (c) For LGD models that result from a combination of different components (for example, secured and unsecured components), the back-testing analysis referred to in paragraph 218(c)(ii) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD should be run at both component and facility level. (d) In addition, institutions should consider in their frameworks for the review of estimates the availability of data for different exposure types, taking into account the specificities of the model architecture, including the existing and potential risk drivers, under paragraph 220 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD. When data are scarce, they should use complementary analyses for those exposure types where quantitative measures prove inconclusive as a result, for example, of the low number of exposures available. (e) Where internal data are not considered sufficient to establish fixed targets and tolerances for defined metrics and tools to assess the performance of the PD model in terms of risk differentiation, institutions should define and put in place the appropriate actions to address this. These actions could encompass, for example, the use of complementary analyses for those cases where the results for the application of metrics and tools are proven to be inconclusive. (f) When external credit bureau scores or ratings are used as the main (or one of the main) driver(s) of the internal rating, in cases where significant changes are applied to the credit bureau scoring institutions should consider the possibility of adjusting their internal data following the changes applied to the score, and whenever the input variables are no longer considered appropriate in their credit rating process."
,,,,144,"In the case of material models where the assignment of the grade is based on a statistical model and where there is a risk that slight changes in the ranking of the obligors, or in the boundaries between grades, could lead to significant changes in the RWEA in that portfolio, the framework referred to in paragraph 141 should also include an analysis of whether the inclusion of the most recent data in the RDS used for model development would lead to materially different model outcomes. This analysis should be conducted on a three-yearly basis, or more often, depending on the materiality of the model. The analysis should consider, in particular, whether the discriminatory power of the PD, LGD or CCF models would be materially increased when re-estimating the model parameters on the basis of the updated RDS. Portfolios should be considered as falling into this category when, for example: (i) a limited number of obligors represent an important share of the total exposure; or (ii) exposures are concentrated near the boundaries between two grades."
,,,,145,"When the number of default observations is low, to analyse whether the main drivers of the observed defaults are appropriately reflected in the model in accordance with Article 179(1)(a) of the CRR institutions should analyse individual defaults (or at least a sample of them where the number of defaults makes analysing all of them unduly burdensome). However, the model should not be adapted simply to fit singular events from the institution's file review."
,,,,146,"In accordance with Article 172(3) of the CRR, for grade and pool assignments institutions must document those situations in which human judgement may override the inputs or outputs of the assignment process. In addition, institutions must complement the statistical model by human judgement and human oversight to review model-based assignments and ensure that the models are used appropriately. Furthermore, review procedures must be designed to find and limit errors associated with model weaknesses. To comply with these requirements, institutions should assess the impact of the application of human judgement on risk differentiation capability (e.g. on discriminatory power), under paragraph 218(b) of the EBA GL on PD and LGD."
,9 Calculation of maturity for non-retail exposures,,,,
,,9.1 Relevant regulatory references,,,
,,,,147,"For the cases described in Article 162(2)(f) of the CRR, the maturity parameter (M) must be the maximum remaining time (in years) that the obligor is permitted to take to fully discharge its contractual obligations. In the ECB's understanding, M should be calculated using the expiry date of a facility. The repayment date of a current drawn amount should not be used."
,,,,148,"To ensure that the calculation of the maturity parameter is correct and to avoid any possible errors, for the purposes of Article 162(3) of the CRR institutions should adequately justify and document any exemptions from the one-year maturity floor."
