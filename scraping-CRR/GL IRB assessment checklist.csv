,,,"0 0 FINAL Draft RTS on the specification of the assessment methodology for competent authoritiesregarding compliance of an institution with the requirementsto use the IRB Approach in accordance with Articles 144(2), 173(3) and 180(3)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No â€¦/.. of XXX supplementing Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for the specification of the assessment methodology competent authorities shall follow in assessing the compliance of an institution with the requirements to use the IRB Approach in accordance with Articles 144(2), 173(3) and 180(3)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 , and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 144(2), the third subparagraph of Article 173(3) and the third subparagraph of Article 180(3) thereof, Whereas:"
,,,"(1) The requirement, in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 for competent authorities to assess the compliance of an institution with the requirements to use the IRB Approach is general, in that relates to all of the requirements for the use of the IRB Approach, irrespective of their degree of materiality, and implies compliance with the requirements at all times. As a result, such an assessment does not only relate to the initial application of an institution for the permission to use the rating systems in accordance with Articles 143(1), 151(4) and (9) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, but also applies to: the assessment of any additional applications of an institution for the permission to use the rating systems implemented according to the institution's approved plan of sequential implementation of the IRB Approach as referred to in Article 148 of that Regulation; the assessment of the application for material changes to the internal approaches that the institution has received permission to use in accordance with Article 143(3) of that Regulation and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014 ; to the assessment of application to return to the use of less sophisticated approaches in accordance with Article 149 of that Regulation; to the ongoing review of the IRB Approach that the institution has received permission to use in accordance with Article 101(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU ; and to changes to the IRB Approach that require notification in accordance with Article 143(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014. Competent authorities should apply the same criteria to all of these particular aspects of the assessment of compliance with the requirements to use the IRB Approach, hence the rules that set out that assessment methodology should apply to all of the above cases, in order to ensure harmonisation of assessment methodologies by competent authorities and mitigate regulatory arbitrage."
,,,"(2) Based on the need to ensure consistency around the Union with regard to the assessment of the IRB Approach, it is necessary that competent authorities embed the same methods for that assessment in their practices. As a result, it is necessary to identify such a set of core methods to be applied by all competent authorities. Nevertheless, given the nature of the model assessment and the diversity and particularities in the models, competent authorities should be allowed to exercise supervisory judgement in the application of these methods. Further, in certain cases such as where recent assessments, which are based on the core methods, have been made for similar rating systems in the same class of exposures, it would be appropriate to use the results of such assessments, rather than repeat them, where, in the competent authorities' supervisory judgement, those remain materially unchanged. This would ensure avoiding complexity, unnecessary burden and duplication of work where such an assessment has been performed previously by the competent authority."
,,,"(3) In such cases as referred above, where competent authorities assess the compliance of an institution with the requirements to use the IRB Approach, other than the initial application for permission by institutions, given that the assessment relates to a particular scope of application of the IRB Approach, competent authorities should apply only and all of those rules that are relevant to the scope of the assessment by the competent authority in each case using the conclusions from the former assessments as the starting point."
,,,"(4) Where the assessment relates to applications for the permissions referred to in Article 20(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the regulatory technical standards referred to in paragraph 8 of that Article in relation to the joint decision process apply."
,,,"(5) Article 144(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 refers to the assessment of compliance with the requirements of that Regulation in their entirety, and at all times. In that context competent authorities are required to verify compliance of institutions with the specific regulatory requirements, as well as evaluate the overall quality of the solutions, systems and approaches implemented by an institution, and request constant improvements and adaptations to changed circumstances in order to achieve continuous compliance with the requirements of the IRB Approach. With that in mind, such an assessment inevitably involves, to a large extent, a subjective judgement by competent authorities. Hence rules for the assessment methodology on one hand should allow the possibility for competent authorities to exercise their discretion as provided in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 by carrying out additional checks to those specified therein, as necessary and on the other should ensure harmonisation and comparability of supervisory practices across different jurisdictions. For the same reasons, competent authorities should avail of the flexibility necessary to apply the most appropriate method or methods for verifying particular requirements, depending, among others, on the materiality of the types of exposures covered by each rating system, the complexity of the models, the particularities of the situation, the specific solution implemented by the institution, the quality of evidence provided by the institution, the resources available to the competent authorities themselves. Further, and for the same reasons, competent authorities should be able to carry out additional tests and verifications which might be necessary in case of doubts regarding the fulfilment of the requirements of the IRB Approach, and in order to be able to apply the assessment methodology in accordance with the principle of proportionality, which is a general principle of EU law, and hence depending on the nature, size and complexity of an institution's business and structure."
,,,"(6) In order to ensure consistency and comprehensiveness of the assessment of the overall IRB Approach, in the case of subsequent requests for permission on the basis of the approved sequential implementation plan of an institution, competent authorities should base their assessment by applying at least the rules on the use and experience test, assignment to grades or pools, rating systems and risk quantification, as these aspects of the assessment relate to every individual rating system of the IRB Approach."
,,,"(7) In order to assess the adequacy of the application of the IRB Approach all rating systems and related processes have to be verified, where there is delegation by an institution to a third party of tasks, activities or functions related to the design, implementation and validation of rating systems, or obtaining a rating system or pooled data from a third party vendor. In particular adequate controls have to be implemented at the institution and full documentation should be available; further as the management body of the institution is ultimately responsible for the delegated processes and the performance of rating systems obtained from a third party vendor, sufficient in-house understanding needs to be ensured. As a result of the above, all tasks, activities and functions that have been delegated, including the rating systems obtained from the third party vendors have to be assessed by competent authorities in a manner similar to the cases where the IRB Approach has been developed fully via internal processes of the institution."
,,,"(8) In order to avoid misuse of the rules on the sequential implementation of the IRB Approach that could lead to the creation of a quasi permanent partial use of the Standardised Approach, a deadline for the implementation of the so-called 'roll-out plan' is necessary, as well as a limitation of possible changes to the roll-out plan. All exposures covered by the roll-out plan need to have a defined and reasonable maximum timeframe for implementation of the IRB Approach."
,,,"(9) It is important to ensure the independence of the validation function from the credit risk control unit in order to allow for an objective assessment of the rating systems, a limited incentive to disguise the model deficiencies and weaknesses, as well as a fresh view on the rating systems by people not involved in the development process. On the other hand, since both in the credit risk control unit as well as in the validation unit highly qualified staff is required, full independence between the two units might be too burdensome for smaller institutions. As a result of the above, competent authorities should verify that an adequate level of independence is in place, based on the proportionality principle."
,,,"(10) As the rating systems are the core of the IRB Approach, and their quality may impact significantly the level of own funds requirements, the performance of the rating systems should be regularly reviewed. Given that rating systems have to be assessed at least annually by competent authorities (as referred to in Article 78 of Directive 2013/36/EU) and by the internal audit (according to Article 191 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013), and given that, in order for this task to be performed, input from the validation function is necessary, it is appropriate that the validation of the performance of the ratings systems covering material portfolios and back-testing of all other rating systems should be performed at least annually."
,,,"(11) All areas of the IRB Approach should be effectively covered by internal audits. Nevertheless, an efficient use of the internal audit resources should be ensured so that internal audit focuses on the most risky areas. Some flexibility is important particularly in the case of those institutions that use numerous rating systems. As a consequence, competent authorities should verify that annual reviews are performed in order to determine areas that require more thorough reviews during the year."
,,,"(12) In order to ensure a minimum level of harmonisation in relation to the scope of use of the rating systems (the so-called 'use test'), competent authorities should verify that the rating systems are incorporated in the relevant processes of the institution within the broader processes of risk management, credit approval and decision- making processes, internal capital allocation, and corporate governance functions. These are basic areas where internal processes require the use of risk parameters, therefore if there are differences between the risk parameters used in those areas and those used for the purpose of the calculation of own funds requirements, they have to be well justified."
,,,"(13) In relation to experience test requirements, while assessing whether the rating systems used by the institution prior to the application to use the IRB Approach were 'broadly in line' with the IRB requirements, competent authorities should verify in particular that during at least three years before the use of the IRB Approach, the rating system has been used in the internal risk measurement and management processes of the institution and that it has been subject to monitoring, internal validation and internal audit. Such specification is necessary to ensure a minimum level of harmonisation. At least the most basic areas of use have to be covered to prove that the rating systems have been effectively used by the institution and that both the personnel as well as the management are accustomed to those parameters and understand well their meaning and weaknesses. Finally, monitoring, validation and internal audit during the experience period should ensure that the rating systems were compliant with the basic requirements of the IRB Approach and that they were gradually improved during that time."
,,,"(14) Independence of the process of assignment of exposures to grades or pools is required for non-retail exposures because the application of human judgement is typically necessary in the process. In the case of retail exposures the assignment process is usually fully automatic, based on objective information about the obligor and his transactions. The correctness of the assignment process is ensured by proper implementation of the rating system in the institution's IT systems and procedures. Nevertheless if overrides are allowed human judgement has to be applied in the rating process. As a result, and given that people responsible for origination or renewal of exposures are typically inclined to assign better ratings in order to increase sales and volumes of credits, where overrides are used, including in the case of retail exposures,  the assignment should be approved by an individual or by a committee independent from the persons responsible for the origination or renewal of exposures."
,,,"(15) Where ratings are older than 12 months or where the review of the assignment has not been performed in due time according to the institution's policy, conservative adjustments should be performed in terms of the risk weighted assets calculation. The reasons for that are multiple. If the rating is outdated or based on outdated information the risk assessment might not be accurate. In particular, if the situation of the obligor has deteriorated during the last 12 months it is not reflected in the rating, and the risk is underestimated. In addition, according to the general rule related to the estimation of the risk parameters, whenever there is uncertainty related to insufficient data or assumptions, an increased margin of conservatism should be adopted. The same rule should apply to the process of assignment of exposures to grades or pools, i.e. due to insufficient information having been taken into account in the assignment process, an additional margin of conservatism should be adopted in the calculation of risk weights. The method of applying additional margin of conservatism in the calculation of risk weights should not be specified as the institution may adjust either the rating, the risk parameter estimation or the risk weight directly. The adjustment should be proportional to the length of the period during which the rating or the information underlying the rating is out-of-date."
,,,"(16) Article 175(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 requires institutions to document the specific definitions of default and loss used internally and ensure consistency with the definitions set out in that Regulation. In assessing this consistency each institution should therefore have clear policies that specify when an obligor or facility is classified as being in default. These should be consistent with the general principles regarding default as referred to in Article 178, paragraphs (1) to (3) of that Regulation. These policies should also be embedded into the institutions' risk management processes and systems since Article 144(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 requires in particular that internal ratings, i.e. including the assignment to a default rating grade, play an essential role in the risk management and other internal processes of an institution."
,,,"(17) The information on the performance of an obligor and on the exposures in default and those not in-default, is the basis for the institution's internal processes, for the quantification of risk parameters and for the calculation of own funds requirements. Therefore not only the identification of defaulted obligors but also the process of reclassification of defaulted obligors to non-defaulted status should be robust and effective. The prudent reclassification process should make sure that obligors are not reclassified to a non-defaulted status where the institution expects that the exposure will probably return to default in a short period of time."
,,,"(18) In order to provide competent authorities with a consistent and accurate overview of the rating systems that the institution has been using as well as their improvement over time, it is necessary for competent authorities to assess the completeness of the register of the current and historical versions of rating systems used by the institution ('register of rating systems'). Given that the requirements of the experience test relate to the preceding three years from the time of consideration of an application for approval of an internal model, and given that there is also the requirement of overall review of the internal model by competent authorities on a regular basis, and at least every 3 years, as referred to in Article 101 of Directive 2013/36/EU, it would be appropriate for competent authorities to verify that such a register of rating systems covers at least the versions of the internal models used by the institution over the three preceding years."
,,,"(19) Human judgement is used at various stages of the development and use of rating systems. Reasonable application of human judgement can increase the quality of the model and the accuracy of its predictions. Nevertheless, since human judgement changes the estimates based on prior experience in a subjective manner, the application of human judgement should be controlled and justified by a positive impact on the accuracy of predictions. Thus, a large number of overrides of the results of the model might indicate that some important information is not included in the rating system. Therefore competent authorities should verify that the number and justifications for overrides is regularly analysed by institutions and that any detected weaknesses of the model are adequately addressed in the model review."
,,,"(20) In all cases the competent authorities should assess whether the institution has adopted sufficient margin of conservatism, as referred to in Article 179(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. This conservatism should account, in particular, for any identified deficiencies in data or methods used in the risk quantification and increased uncertainty that might result for example from the changes in the lending or recovery policies. The competent authorities should verify that the margin of conservatism is applied irrespective of the requirements of Article 146 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, as that Article aims at ensuring that models are corrected in a timely manner to meet the requirements of that Regulation; hence the application of the margin of conservatism should not be used as an alternative to correcting the models and ensuring their full compliance with the requirements of that Regulation."
,,,"(21) It is desirable that the PD estimates are relatively stable over time in order to avoid the excessive cyclicality of own funds requirements. To achieve that, the PD estimates should be based on the long-run average of yearly default rates. In addition, as the own funds should help institutions survive in a time of stress, the risk estimates should take into account the possible deterioration in the economic conditions even in the times of prosperity. Finally, whenever there is an increased uncertainty that results from insufficient data, an additional margin of conservatism should be adopted. If the length of available time series does not encompass the expected variability of default rates, appropriate methods should be adopted to account for the missing data."
,,,"(22) The LGD estimation is required to be based on the average weighted by the number of defaults, as provided by Article 181(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. If however the exposure value is a relevant risk driver, it should be considered among other potential risk drivers for the segregation or risk differentiation of LGD in order to ensure that the parameter is calculated for homogenous pools or facility grades. This approach ensures consistency with the calculation of the PD parameter and a meaningful application of the risk weight formula. Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 distinguishes the LGD calculation method at the level of individual exposures for the purpose of risk weighted exposure amounts from the LGD calculated at the portfolio level. Differently from the individual LGD calculation, the LGD floor for exposures secured by immovable property, applied at the overall portfolio level, is defined as an exposure-weighted average LGD."
,,,"(23) Defaulted exposures that, after the return to non-defaulted status, are classified as defaulted again in a short period of time should be treated as constantly defaulted from the first moment when the default occurred, as the temporary reclassification to nondefaulted status is most likely performed on the basis of incomplete information on the real situation of the obligor. As a result the treatment of multiple defaults as one default better represents the real default experience and competent authorities should treat  multiple defaults of the same obligor within a short period of time as one default. Further, the treatment of multiple defaults of the same obligor as separate defaults might lead to significant errors in risk parameter estimates, because higher default rates would lead to higher PD estimates. On the other hand the LGD would be underestimated, because the first defaults of the obligor would be treated as cure cases with no loss related to them, where in fact the institution experienced loss on that obligor; Additionally, due to the relations between PD and LGD estimates and in order to ensure adequate estimation of expected loss, the treatment of multiple defaults should be consistent for the purpose of PD and LGD estimation."
,,,"(24) The scope of information available for the institution with regard to defaulted exposures is significantly different from the performing exposures. In particular, two additional risk drivers are available, namely the time in-default and recoveries realised. Therefore the estimation of LGD at a time before the default is not sufficient, because the risk estimates should take into account all significant risk drivers. Additionally, for defaulted exposures it is already known what the economic conditions were at the moment of default. Further, LGD for defaulted exposures should reflect the sum of expected loss under current economic circumstances and possible unexpected loss that might occur during the recovery period. Therefore competent authorities should verify that LGD in-default is estimated either directly or as a sum of best estimate of expected loss ('ELbe') and an add-on that captures the unexpected loss that might occur during the recovery period. Irrespective of the approach applied the estimation of LGD indefault should take into account the information on the time in-default and recoveries realised so far and consider a possible adverse change in economic conditions during the expected length of the recovery process."
,,,"(25) In the case of institutions using own-LGD estimates internal requirements for collateral management should be generally consistent with requirements of Section 3, Chapter 4, Title II in Part three of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Competent authorities should focus in particular on the requirements of collateral valuation and legal certainty. This is because it is important to ensure regular and reliable valuation of collateral, and that the valuation reflects the real market value under current market conditions. The frequency and character of revaluation should be adjusted to the type of collateral, as outdated or inaccurate evaluation might lead to the underestimation of risk related with the credit exposures. It is also crucial to ensure that the collateral is legally effective and enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions. In the contrary case, the exposure should be treated as unsecured; if nevertheless such collateral is recognised in the risk quantification, it may lead to the underestimation of risk."
,,,"(26) For the purpose of the advanced IRB Approach, i.e. where own-LGD estimates are used, eligible guarantors are those that are rated with a rating system approved under the IRB Approach. Other guarantors may also be eligible, provided that they are classified as an institution, a central government or central bank, or a corporate entity that has a credit assessment by an ECAI, and the guarantee meets the requirements set out in Section 3, Chapter 4, Title II in Part three of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, which are also applicable for the Standardised Approach. The effect of the guarantee may be recognised through the adjustment of PD or LGD estimates. In the case of the guarantors that are internally rated with a rating system approved under the IRB Approach the effect of the guarantee can alternatively be recognised by applying Article 153(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Such an approach towards the eligibility of the guarantors is prudent and ensures that the quality of the guarantee and  the guarantor is properly assessed in order to include it in the risk estimates for the purpose of the calculation of own funds requirements."
,,,"(27) In the assessment of the process of assignment of exposures to exposure classes, competent authorities should focus on the assignment of exposures to retail exposures because of their preferential treatment in terms of risk weighted exposure amounts calculation."
,,,"(28) Some exposure classes are defined on the basis of the characteristics of the transaction and others on the basis of the type of obligor; as a result, there might be exposures that fulfil the criteria of more than one exposure classes. Therefore there is a need for competent authorities to verify that the institution applies the correct sequencing in order to ensure the consistent and unequivocal assignment of exposures to exposure classes."
,,,"(29) The results of the stress tests should be taken into account in the decision making process in the area of risk and capital management processes, because the integration of the stress tests results in the decision making processes ensures that the scenarios and their impact on own funds requirements are developed and performed in a meaningful manner and that forward-looking aspects of own funds requirements are taken into account in managing the institution."
,,,"(30) Institutions that use own-LGD and own conversion factors estimates should calculate effective maturity of the exposures under the IRB Approach for the purpose of the calculation of own funds requirements. In the case of revolving exposures, an institution is at risk for a longer period than the repayment date of the current drawing, given that the borrower may redraw additional amounts. Therefore, competent authorities should verify that the calculation of effective maturity of revolving exposures is based on the expiry date of the facility."
,,,"(31) The calculation of the difference between expected loss amounts and credit risk adjustments, additional value adjustments and other own funds reductions ('IRB shortfall') in line with Article 159 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should be performed on an aggregate level separately for the portfolio of defaulted exposures and the portfolio of exposures that are not in default. The separation between defaulted and non-defaulted exposures is necessary in order to ensure that the negative amounts resulting from the calculation performed for the defaulted portfolio are not used to offset the positive amounts resulting from the calculation performed for the portfolio of exposures that are not in default. Apart from that the overall calculation is in line with the general concept of own funds, according to which the own funds should be fully available to cover unexpected losses in case of insolvency of the institution. Since the amounts of credit risk adjustments, additional value adjustments and other own funds reductions included in the calculation of IRB shortfall have already been deducted from own funds to cover the expected losses ('EL'), their excess part on the total EL is fully available to cover losses identified on all defaulted exposures. Therefore only the overall IRB shortfall, where the amount of provisions does not fully cover the EL of defaulted exposures, should be deducted from the own funds."
,,,"(32) Unreliable, inaccurate, incomplete or outdated data may lead to errors in the risk estimation and in the calculation of own funds requirements. Further, when used in the risk management processes of the institution such data may also lead to wrong credit and management decisions. Consequently, in order to ensure reliability and high quality of data the infrastructure related to gathering and storing of data as well as the  relevant procedures have to be well documented, and there needs to be a full description of the characteristics and the sources of data in order to ensure their proper use in the internal processes and the processes for the calculation of own funds requirements. Hence competent authorities, in the assessment of the IRB Approach, should put particular attention to the quality and documentation of data used in the process of the development of rating systems, in the assignment of exposures to grades or pools and in the calculation of own funds requirements."
,,,"(33) The quality of data and the correctness of risk estimation and of calculation of own funds requirements are highly dependent on the reliability of the IT systems used for the purpose of the IRB Approach. Further, the continuity and consistency of the risk management processes and the calculation of own funds requirements can only be ensured when the IT systems used for those purposes are safe, secure and reliable and the IT infrastructure is sufficiently robust. As a consequence, it is necessary that, in the course of the assessment of the IRB Approach, competent authorities also verify the reliability of the institution's IT systems and the robustness of the IT infrastructure."
,,,"(34) As far as possible non-overlapping observations of returns on equity exposures should be used both for the purpose of development as well as for the validation of internal models for equity exposures. This is because non-overlapping observations ensure higher quality of predictions, given that all observations are assigned the same weight and the observations are not closely correlated to each other."
,,,"(35) The use of the IRB Approach requires approval of the competent authorities and similarly any material changes to that approach have to be approved. As a result, competent authorities should verify that internal process of management and in particular approval of changes ensure that only the changes of good quality are implemented and, in that context, that the classification of changes is consistent in order to avoid any arbitrage."
,,,"(36) The provisions in this Regulation are closely linked, since they all deal with aspects of the assessment methodology that competent authorities are to follow in assessing the compliance of an institution with the IRB Approach. To ensure coherence between those provisions, which should enter into force at the same time, and to facilitate a comprehensive view and compact access to them by persons subject to those obligations, it is desirable to include all of the regulatory technical standards required by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 in a single Regulation."
,,,(37) This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the European Banking Authority to the Commission.
,,,"(38) The European Banking Authority has conducted open public consultations on the draft regulatory technical standards on which this Regulation is based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the Banking Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council , HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:"

Such assessment shall be carried out separately for each rating system and each risk parameter."
CHAPTER 6 Assessment methodology for definition of default,,,
,,Article 26 General,
,,,1. In order to assess whether the institution effectively identifies all defaults in accordance with Article 178 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 competent authorities shall verify in particular all of the following:
,,,"(a) the compliance of an institution with, and the operationalization of, the triggers for identification of default of an obligor, in accordance with Article 27;"

,,,(c) perform their own tests on institution's data or request the institution to perform tests proposed by the competent authorities;
,,,(d) review other relevant documents of the institution.
,,Article 27 Trigger events for the default of an obligor,
,,,"1. In assessing the compliance with and operationalization of the triggers for identification of default of an obligor applied by the institution as referred to in Article 26(1)(a), competent authorities shall verify in particular that:"
,,,"(a) there is an adequate policy in place with regard to the counting of days past due, including in particular re-ageing of facilities, granting of extensions, amendments or deferrals, renewals and netting of existing accounts;"

,,,"(c) where an institution uses multiple definitions of default within one or more legal entities, that the scope of application of each definition of default is clearly specified and that the differences between the definitions are justified."
,,,"2. For the purpose of paragraph 1, competent authorities shall assess whether the definition of default is sufficiently implemented and detailed enough to be applied consistently by all members of staff for all types of exposures in order to ensure, in particular whether all of the following potential indicators of unlikeness to pay are sufficiently specified:"
,,,(a) the non-accrued status;
,,,(b) events that constitute specific credit risk adjustments resulting from a significant perceived decline in credit quality;
,,,(c) sales of credit obligations that constitute a material credit-related economic loss;
,,,(d) events that constitute a distressed restructuring;
,,,(e) events that constitute a similar protection as bankruptcy;

,,,"(a) there are adequate procedures and mechanisms in place to ensure that all defaults are identified in a timely manner, in particular that the gathering and updating of relevant information are effective and take place with sufficient frequency;"
,,,"(b) where the identification of default of an obligor is based on automatic processes, the correctness of implementation of the default definition in the IT system is evidenced by the relevant implementation tests;"
,,,(c) where the identification of default of an obligor is based on human judgement the definitions and trigger events of default are sufficiently detailed to ensure consistency in the identification of defaults by all relevant staff;
,,,"(d) where the institution applies the definition of default at the obligor level, there are adequate procedures and mechanisms in place to ensure that once default is identified for an obligor all exposures to that obligor are registered as being in default across all relevant systems, business lines and geographical locations within the institution and its subsidiaries, or where applicable, within its parent undertaking, and its subsidiaries;"
,,,"(e) where there is a time delay with regard to the assignment of the defaulted status across all exposures to an obligor as referred to in point (d), that time delay does not lead to errors or inconsistencies in risk management, risk reporting, the calculation of own funds requirements or the use of data in risk quantification."
,,,"2. For the purpose of paragraph 1, competent authorities shall assess the application of the materiality threshold in the default definition and its consistency with the materiality threshold of a credit obligation past due, defined by the competent authorities in accordance with Commission Delegated Regulation adopting the technical standards laid down in Article 178(6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, and shall verify, in particular, that:"
,,,(a) there are adequate procedures and mechanisms in place to ensure that all credit obligations that are past due above the threshold are assigned the defaulted status;
,,,"(b) the process of counting of days past due is consistent with the contractual or legal obligations of an obligor, reflects adequately partial payments and is applied consistently."
,,,"3. In the case of retail exposures, in addition to the verification laid down in paragraph 1 and the assessment laid down in paragraph 2, competent authorities shall verify that:"
,,,(a) the institution has a clear policy with regard to the application of the default definition for retail exposures either at the level of the obligor or at the level of the individual credit facility;
,,,(b) the policy referred to in point (a) is aligned with the institution's risk management and is applied consistently;
,,,(c) where the institution applies the definition of default at the level of the individual facility:
,,,"(i) there are adequate procedures and mechanisms in place to ensure that once a credit facility is identified as being in default, that credit facility is marked as being in default across all relevant systems within the institution;"
,,,"(ii) where there is a time delay with regard to the assignment of the defaulted status of a facility across all relevant systems as referred to in point (i), that time delay does not lead to errors or inconsistencies in risk management, risk reporting, the calculation of own funds requirements or the use of data in risk quantification."
,,Article 29 Return to non-defaulted status,
,,,"4. In assessing the robustness of the trigger events and process of reclassification of a defaulted obligor to a non-defaulted status as referred to in Article 26(1)(c), competent authorities shall verify in particular that:"
,,,(a) the trigger events for reclassification are determined for each trigger of default and that the treatment of credit obligations subject to distressed restructuring is specified;
,,,(b) reclassification is possible only after no trigger of default continues to apply and all relevant conditions for reclassification are met;
,,,"(c) the trigger events and process of reclassification are prudent, in particular that reclassification to a non-defaulted status is not performed where the institution expects that the credit obligation will probably not be paid in full without recourse by the institution to actions such as realising security."
,,,"5. For the purpose of paragraph 1, competent authorities shall verify that the institution's policies and procedures do not allow for reclassification of a defaulted obligor to a non- defaulted obligor status only as result of changes in the terms or conditions of the credit obligations, unless the institution has assessed that those changes enable the obligor to be considered as no longer being unlikely to pay."
,,,6. Competent authorities shall assess the robustness of the institution's analysis on which it has based its approach on reclassification. They shall verify that the analysis takes into account the institution's previous default experience and the portion of defaulted obligors that return to non-defaulted status and default again within a short period of time.
